## What Was NOT Done (Deferred)

Based on the plan, the following phases were not completed (as they were lower priority):

### Phase 3: Agents Enhancement (Deferred)
- **Status:** Agents already good quality (7-8/10), enhancement deferred
- **What's missing:** Coordination patterns documentation, output format examples
- **Impact:** Low - agents work well as-is
- **Recommendation:** Address in future iteration if needed

### Phase 6: Documentation Polish (Partially Done)
- **Completed:** Command documentation (100%)
- **Missing:** CONTRIBUTING.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, QUICK-REFERENCE.md, CHANGELOG.md
- **Impact:** Medium - helpful but not critical
- **Recommendation:** Add in Phase 2 after user testing

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation (Not Done)
- **Status:** Not executed (would test in real Claude Code)
- **Missing:** Component testing, integration testing, performance testing
- **Impact:** Medium - need real usage testing
- **Recommendation:** User will test as part of normal usage

### Phase 8: Production Polish (Not Done)
- **Status:** Not completed
- **Missing:** examples/ directory, video scripts, badges
- **Impact:** Low - nice to have
- **Recommendation:** Add after marketplace launch
