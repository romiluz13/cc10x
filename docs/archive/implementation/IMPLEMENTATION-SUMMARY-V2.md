## What Was NOT Implemented (Intentional)

### From Spec Kit
- ❌ Python CLI tool (plugin is simpler)
- ❌ AI-agnostic design (Claude focus intentional)
- ❌ Cross-platform PowerShell scripts (not needed)

### From BMAD
- ❌ Expansion pack architecture (out of scope)
- ❌ Web bundle builder (not relevant)
- ❌ Build system (unnecessary complexity)
- ❌ Document sharding (progressive loading superior)
- ❌ Config file (hardcoded paths work fine)

**Rationale:** These features don't align with cc10x's core value proposition: fast, strict, efficient software development for Claude Code users.
