# Iteration 2: Commands & Workflows Deep Dive

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Research Phase:** Command Structure & Workflow Analysis  
**Focus:** How commands orchestrate development workflows

---

## Executive Summary

All three systems use command-based workflows but with fundamentally different philosophies:

- **Spec Kit**: Linear spec → plan → tasks → implement pipeline with constitutional gates
- **BMAD METHOD**: Iterative agent-driven cycle with hyper-detailed story files
- **cc10x**: Orchestrated multi-phase workflows with strict TDD and parallel verification

**Key Finding**: cc10x's orchestration model is more sophisticated than Spec Kit's linear flow and simpler than BMAD's complex agent coordination.

## 1. Command System Comparison

### 1.1 Spec Kit Commands

**Core Commands (5):**

| Command | Purpose | Output | Prerequisites |
|---------|---------|--------|---------------|
| `/speckit.constitution` | Create project principles | `memory/constitution.md` | None |
| `/speckit.specify` | Create feature spec | `specs/###-name/spec.md` | None |
| `/speckit.clarify` | Resolve ambiguities | Updated `spec.md` | spec.md exists |
| `/speckit.plan` | Technical implementation plan | `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/` | spec.md complete |
| `/speckit.tasks` | Generate task breakdown | `tasks.md` | plan.md complete |
| `/speckit.implement` | Execute implementation | Working code | tasks.md complete |
| `/speckit.analyze` | Cross-artifact validation | Analysis report (read-only) | tasks.md exists |

**Command Characteristics:**
- **Sequential**: Each command builds on previous (strict dependency chain)
- **Template-driven**: Commands fill templates with AI-generated content
- **Script integration**: Commands run bash/PowerShell scripts for setup
- **Branch management**: Auto-creates branches from feature names
- **Constitution-enforced**: All commands check against `memory/constitution.md`
- **Read-only analysis**: `/speckit.analyze` validates without modifying

**Workflow:**
```
Constitution → Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement
                ↓           ↓        ↓       ↓       ↓          ↓
         spec.md    refined   plan.md  tasks.md  report    code
```

### 1.2 BMAD METHOD Commands

**Core Agents with Commands:**

| Agent | Role | Commands | Outputs |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Analyst** | Research | `*brief`, `*research` | Project briefs, market analysis |
| **PM** | Product | `*create` (PRD) | `docs/prd.md` |
| **Architect** | Technical | `*create` (arch) | `docs/architecture.md` |
| **PO** | Validation | `*shard`, `*validate` | Sharded epics/stories |
| **SM** | Story Drafting | `*create` (story), `*draft` | `docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.md` |
| **Dev** | Implementation | `*implement`, `*test` | Source code |
| **QA** | Quality | `*risk`, `*design`, `*trace`, `*nfr`, `*review`, `*gate` | QA assessments, quality gates |

**Command Characteristics:**
- **Agent-scoped**: Commands belong to specific agents (e.g., `@sm *create`)
- **Task-based**: Commands invoke task files (e.g., `*create` → `create-next-story.md`)
- **Context-rich**: Story files contain ALL context needed for dev
- **Sequential within cycle**: SM → Dev → QA (but cycles repeat)
- **Config-driven**: `core-config.yaml` defines paths and behavior
- **Dependency system**: YAML defines which templates/tasks/data each agent can use

**Workflow:**
```
Analyst → PM (PRD) → Architect → PO (Shard) → [SM → Dev → QA]* (cycle)
                                                    ↓     ↓     ↓
                                                 draft  code  gate
```

### 1.3 cc10x Commands

**Core Commands (4):**

| Command | Purpose | Phases | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| `/feature-plan` | PRD-style planning | 5 phases | Feature plan document |
| `/feature-build` | TDD implementation | 5 phases | Production code + tests |
| `/bug-fix` | Systematic debugging | 5 phases | Minimal fix + tests |
| `/review` | Multi-dimensional review | Parallel 5 reviewers | Analysis report |

**Command Characteristics:**
- **Orchestrated**: Commands dispatch specialized sub-agents
- **Phase-based**: Each command has 5 defined phases
- **TDD-enforced**: Mandatory RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **Parallel execution**: Review uses 5 simultaneous reviewers
- **Auto-healing**: Commands snapshot context at 75% tokens
- **Progressive loading**: 93% token savings through staged context
- **Quality gates**: Mandatory gates between phases

**Workflow:**
```
Command → [Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5] → Production Code
            ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓
         Context   Plan    Implement  Verify    Finalize
                                         ↓
                              [5 parallel reviewers]
```

## 2. Workflow Pattern Analysis

### 2.1 Spec Kit Workflow Patterns

**Linear Sequential Flow:**

```
Step 1: Constitution (/speckit.constitution)
  ├─> Creates: memory/constitution.md
  └─> Purpose: Define immutable project principles

Step 2: Specification (/speckit.specify)
  ├─> Runs: create-new-feature.sh
  ├─> Creates: specs/###-name/spec.md
  ├─> Auto: Creates branch, initializes structure
  └─> Validation: Spec quality checklist

Step 3: Clarification (/speckit.clarify - optional)
  ├─> Max 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
  ├─> Interactive Q&A with options
  └─> Updates: spec.md with answers

Step 4: Plan (/speckit.plan)
  ├─> Reads: spec.md + constitution.md
  ├─> Creates: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
  ├─> Gates: Constitution compliance checks
  └─> Tracks: Complexity violations

Step 5: Tasks (/speckit.tasks)
  ├─> Reads: plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/
  ├─> Creates: tasks.md
  ├─> Organizes: By user story with [P] parallel markers
  └─> Includes: File paths, dependencies, checkpoints

Step 6: Analysis (/speckit.analyze - optional)
  ├─> Reads: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
  ├─> Validates: Cross-artifact consistency
  ├─> Reports: Duplications, gaps, constitution violations
  └─> Read-only: No file modifications

Step 7: Implementation (/speckit.implement)
  ├─> Reads: tasks.md
  ├─> Executes: Tasks in dependency order
  ├─> Respects: [P] parallel markers
  └─> Produces: Working code + tests
```

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Template-Driven**: Each step fills a template
2. **Constitution-Enforced**: Gates check against principles
3. **Progressive Detail**: Spec (what) → Plan (how) → Tasks (steps)
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Requirements in spec, tech in plan
5. **Quality Checkpoints**: Checklists and analyze command

### 2.2 BMAD METHOD Workflow Patterns

**Two-Phase Approach:**

**Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Efficient)**
```
Analyst (Optional)
  ├─> *brief: Create project brief
  ├─> *research: Market & competitor analysis
  └─> Output: docs/briefs/{name}.md

PM (Product Manager)
  ├─> *create: Generate PRD from brief
  ├─> Input: Project brief or direct requirements
  └─> Output: docs/prd.md (monolithic)

Architect
  ├─> *create: Design system architecture
  ├─> Input: docs/prd.md
  └─> Output: docs/architecture.md (monolithic)

PO (Product Owner)
  ├─> *validate: Run master checklist
  ├─> *shard: Break PRD into epics
  ├─> *shard: Break Architecture into focused docs
  └─> Outputs: docs/prd/epic-*.md, docs/architecture/*.md

[Transition from Web → IDE]
```

**Phase 2: Development (IDE - Iterative Cycle)**
```
SM (Scrum Master) - Story Drafting
  ├─> *create: Run create-next-story task
  ├─> Reads: Sharded epic, architecture docs, previous story notes
  ├─> Creates: docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.story.md
  ├─> Includes: Full context (Dev Notes section)
  └─> Checklist: story-draft-checklist

Dev (Developer) - Implementation
  ├─> Reads: Story file (self-contained context)
  ├─> Implements: Tasks sequentially
  ├─> Updates: Story checkboxes, File List, Change Log
  └─> Status: Draft → InProgress → Review

QA (Test Architect) - Quality Assurance
  ├─> *risk: Risk profiling (before dev)
  ├─> *design: Test strategy (before dev)
  ├─> *trace: Coverage check (during dev)
  ├─> *nfr: Quality attributes (during dev)
  ├─> *review: Comprehensive review (after dev)
  ├─> Active refactoring: Improve code directly
  └─> *gate: Quality gate decision
      ├─> Creates: docs/qa/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
      └─> Status: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED

[Cycle repeats: SM drafts next story...]
```

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Context-Engineered Stories**: Story files contain ALL context needed
2. **Sequential Cycle**: SM → Dev → QA → repeat
3. **Two Environments**: Web (planning) → IDE (development)
4. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has narrow, deep expertise
5. **Story-Centric**: Story file is single source of truth for dev
6. **Sharding Strategy**: Break large docs into consumable pieces
7. **Quality Gates**: YAML files with deterministic rules

### 2.3 cc10x Workflow Patterns

**Command-Orchestrated Multi-Phase:**

**Command: `/feature-plan`**
```
Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
  └─> Parse user input, extract requirements

Phase 2: Context Analysis
  ├─> Sub-Agent: context-analyzer
  ├─> Skill: codebase-navigation
  └─> Output: Existing patterns, conventions, integration points

Phase 3: Architecture & Design
  ├─> User stories with acceptance criteria
  ├─> Architecture decisions (pros/cons)
  ├─> Component design
  ├─> API specifications
  ├─> Data models
  └─> Edge case identification

Phase 4: Testing Strategy
  └─> Unit, integration, E2E test plans

Phase 5: Implementation Roadmap
  └─> Phased incremental plan

Quality Gate: Complete specification ready for review
```

**Command: `/feature-build`**
```
Phase 1: Context Analysis
  ├─> Sub-Agent: context-analyzer
  ├─> Skill: codebase-navigation
  └─> Find patterns to follow

Phase 2: Planning
  └─> Break into increments (<200 lines each)

Phase 3: Implementation (TDD-Enforced)
  For each increment:
    ├─> RED: Write failing test (skill: test-driven-development)
    ├─> Verify: Test MUST fail
    ├─> GREEN: Minimal code to pass
    ├─> Verify: All tests MUST pass
    └─> REFACTOR: Clean up (keep tests green)

Phase 4: Verification (PARALLEL)
  ├─> Sub-Agent: security-reviewer (skill: security-patterns)
  ├─> Sub-Agent: quality-reviewer (skill: code-review-patterns)
  ├─> Sub-Agent: performance-analyzer (skill: performance-patterns)
  ├─> Sub-Agent: ux-reviewer (skill: ux-patterns)
  └─> Sub-Agent: accessibility-reviewer (skill: accessibility-patterns)
  
  Blocking: Critical security or a11y issues
  Warning: Performance or UX issues

Phase 5: Finalization
  ├─> Remove debug code
  ├─> Generate semantic commit
  └─> Commit with clean message

Quality Gates: After every phase + per increment in Phase 3
```

**Command: `/bug-fix`**
```
Phase 1: Context Gathering
  └─> Understand bug, affected components, evidence

Phase 2: Investigation (LOG FIRST)
  ├─> Add strategic logging
  ├─> Reproduce bug
  ├─> Identify root cause
  └─> Quality Gate: Root cause certain

Phase 3: Fix Implementation
  ├─> RED: Write test that reproduces bug
  ├─> Verify: Test MUST fail
  ├─> GREEN: Minimal fix
  └─> Verify: All tests pass

Phase 4: Verification
  └─> Unit, integration, regression, manual tests

Phase 5: Finalization
  ├─> Remove ALL debug logging
  └─> Semantic commit
```

**Command: `/review`**
```
Phase 1: Scope Analysis
  └─> Determine files/directories to review

Phase 2: Parallel Multi-Dimensional Review
  [5 SIMULTANEOUS sub-agents]
  ├─> security-reviewer
  ├─> quality-reviewer
  ├─> performance-analyzer
  ├─> ux-reviewer
  └─> accessibility-reviewer

Phase 3: Report Compilation
  ├─> Aggregate findings
  ├─> Prioritize by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MED/LOW)
  └─> Generate actionable report
```

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Orchestration-Driven**: Commands coordinate sub-agents
2. **Strict TDD**: Mandatory test-first in all implementations
3. **Parallel Verification**: 5 simultaneous reviewers
4. **Progressive Loading**: 3-stage context loading
5. **Auto-Healing**: Snapshots at 75% token usage
6. **Quality Gates**: Between every phase

## 2. Workflow Philosophy Comparison

### 2.1 Spec Kit: Constitutional Specification-Driven

**Philosophy**: "Specifications are executable and constitution-enforced"

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clear separation: spec (what) → plan (how) → tasks (steps)
- ✅ Constitutional gates prevent over-engineering
- ✅ Template constraints guide LLM behavior
- ✅ Cross-artifact analysis catches inconsistencies
- ✅ AI-agnostic (works with any AI agent)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Linear flow (can't skip steps)
- ❌ No TDD enforcement in templates
- ❌ No parallel execution except task markers
- ❌ No context preservation (manual)
- ❌ Constitution may be overkill for simple projects

**Use When:**
- Building from scratch (greenfield)
- Need constitutional governance
- Want detailed specifications
- Working with non-technical stakeholders

### 2.2 BMAD METHOD: Agentic Collaborative Development

**Philosophy**: "Specialized agents collaborate through context-rich artifacts"

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Agent specialization (15+ distinct personas)
- ✅ Context-engineered stories (dev needs nothing else)
- ✅ QA Test Architect (sophisticated quality control)
- ✅ Two-environment optimization (web for planning, IDE for dev)
- ✅ Expansion packs (domain extensibility)
- ✅ Document sharding (manage large docs)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Complex setup (build system, installers)
- ❌ Environment switching (web → IDE)
- ❌ No strict TDD enforcement
- ❌ Sequential dev cycle (one story at a time)
- ❌ High learning curve (many agents, tasks, workflows)

**Use When:**
- Large projects with detailed planning
- Team collaboration (agent = team member)
- Non-software domains (expansion packs)
- Want comprehensive quality gates

### 2.3 cc10x: Orchestrated Production-Ready Workflow

**Philosophy**: "Orchestrate specialists for production-ready results"

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Strict TDD enforcement** (no exceptions)
- ✅ **Parallel verification** (5 simultaneous reviewers)
- ✅ **Progressive loading** (93% token savings)
- ✅ **Auto-healing** (context preservation)
- ✅ **Simple structure** (no build system)
- ✅ **Production-first** (Lovable/Bolt-quality UI)
- ✅ **Single environment** (no web → IDE switch)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Software development only (not domain-agnostic)
- ❌ No explicit constitution (principles embedded in commands)
- ❌ Less granular than BMAD stories

**Use When:**
- Need production-ready code fast
- Want strict quality enforcement
- Token efficiency matters
- Building software (not other domains)

## 3. Command Implementation Deep Dive

### 3.1 Spec Kit Command Structure

**Example: `/speckit.specify` Command**

```markdown
---
description: Create feature specification
scripts:
  sh: scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "{ARGS}"
  ps: scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "{ARGS}"
---

## Outline

1. Generate concise short name (2-4 words)
2. Run script to create branch & structure
3. Load spec-template.md
4. Fill template sections:
   - User Scenarios & Testing
   - Functional Requirements (FR-001, FR-002...)
   - Success Criteria (measurable)
   - Edge Cases
5. Create spec quality checklist
6. Validate against checklist (max 3 iterations)
7. Handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (max 3)
8. Report completion
```

**Template Constraints on LLM:**
- ✅ Prevent implementation details in specs
- ✅ Force explicit uncertainty markers
- ✅ Structured thinking through checklists
- ✅ Constitutional compliance through gates
- ✅ Prevent speculative features
- ✅ Test-first thinking

**Innovation**: Templates act as "sophisticated prompts" that constrain LLM output for better quality.

### 3.2 BMAD METHOD Command Structure

**Example: SM's `*create` (create-next-story task)**

```markdown
# Create Next Story Task

## Sequential Execution

Step 0: Load core-config.yaml
  └─> Get paths, config, workflow settings

Step 1: Identify Next Story
  ├─> Scan existing stories (find highest)
  ├─> Check if previous complete
  ├─> Alert if incomplete (user can override)
  └─> Never auto-skip epics (user must choose)

Step 2: Gather Requirements
  ├─> Read epic file for story requirements
  └─> Read previous story's Dev Agent Record

Step 3: Gather Architecture Context
  ├─> Determine reading strategy (sharded vs monolithic)
  ├─> For ALL stories: tech-stack, structure, standards, testing
  ├─> For Backend: data-models, schema, api-spec
  ├─> For Frontend: frontend-arch, components, workflows
  └─> Extract ONLY story-relevant details (cite sources)

Step 4: Verify Project Structure
  └─> Cross-reference with unified-project-structure.md

Step 5: Populate Story Template
  ├─> Fill basic info (title, status, story, AC)
  ├─> **Dev Notes** (CRITICAL):
      ├─> Previous story insights
      ├─> Data models [Source: ...]
      ├─> API specs [Source: ...]
      ├─> Component specs [Source: ...]
      ├─> File locations
      ├─> Testing requirements
      └─> Technical constraints
  ├─> **Tasks**: Generate from epic + architecture
  └─> All with source citations

Step 6: Story Draft Completion
  ├─> Execute story-draft-checklist
  └─> Report to user
```

**Innovation**: Story files are "hyper-contextualized" - dev agent needs nothing else.

### 3.3 cc10x Command Structure

**Example: `/feature-build` Command**

```markdown
---
name: feature-build
description: Complete feature implementation with TDD
aliases: [build, implement, develop]
category: development
priority: 10
---

Phase 1: Context Analysis (Sub-Agent: context-analyzer)
  ├─> Find similar features in codebase
  ├─> Identify project conventions
  ├─> Map integration points
  └─> Gate: Clear pattern understanding

Phase 2: Planning
  ├─> Decompose into increments (<200 lines each)
  ├─> Define test-first approach for each
  └─> Gate: Clear implementation plan

Phase 3: Implementation (Sub-Agent: implementer)
  For each increment:
    ├─> Skill: test-driven-development
    ├─> RED: Write failing test → MUST FAIL
    ├─> GREEN: Minimal code → MUST PASS
    ├─> REFACTOR: Clean up → MUST STAY GREEN
    ├─> Verify: Coverage >80%, no linting errors
    └─> Gate: Increment complete

Phase 4: Verification (5 PARALLEL sub-agents)
  ├─> security-reviewer (skill: security-patterns) → Block if critical
  ├─> quality-reviewer (skill: code-review-patterns) → Block if major
  ├─> performance-analyzer (skill: performance-patterns) → Warn
  ├─> ux-reviewer (skill: ux-patterns) → Warn
  └─> accessibility-reviewer (skill: accessibility-patterns) → Block if critical
  
  Gate: No critical issues

Phase 5: Finalization
  ├─> Remove debug code
  ├─> Generate semantic commit message
  └─> Commit with stats

Skill Auto-Activation:
  - "implement" → test-driven-development
  - "write code" → code-generation
  - "verify" → verification-before-completion
```

**Innovation**: Three-layer orchestration (command → agent → skill) with auto-activation.

## 4. Key Differentiators

### 4.1 Template vs Task vs Skill

**Spec Kit Templates:**
- Static markdown with placeholders
- LLM fills in based on user input
- Constraints embedded in template
- Constitution gates enforce principles

**BMAD Tasks:**
- Procedural instructions for agents
- Sequential steps with conditions
- Dependency system (YAML)
- Source citation required

**cc10x Skills:**
- Auto-activating domain knowledge
- 15 trigger phrases each
- Progressive loading (3 stages)
- Activated by agents when relevant

### 4.2 Quality Gate Approaches

**Spec Kit:**
- Constitutional gates (Phase -1, Phase 0)
- Checklist validations
- `/speckit.analyze` for consistency
- Template-enforced constraints

**BMAD:**
- QA agent with 6 commands (*risk, *design, *trace, *nfr, *review, *gate)
- Deterministic gate rules (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED)
- Risk scoring (Probability × Impact)
- Active refactoring during review

**cc10x:**
- Per-phase quality gates (mandatory)
- TDD cycle gates (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Multi-dimensional parallel review
- Blocking vs Warning issues
- >80% coverage requirement

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | Spec Kit | BMAD | cc10x |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **Gate Type** | Constitutional | Advisory YAML | Mandatory blocking |
| **Enforcement** | Template-driven | QA agent | Command-enforced |
| **Granularity** | Per-phase | Per-story | Per-increment |
| **Automation** | analyze command | QA *review task | Parallel review |
| **TDD Enforcement** | Mentioned | Optional | **STRICT** |

**Winner**: **cc10x** - Most comprehensive and strictly enforced gates

### 4.3 Context Management

**Spec Kit:**
```
Context = Constitution + Spec + Plan + Tasks
- Linear accumulation
- No sharding
- No explicit token management
```

**BMAD:**
```
Context = Config + Sharded Docs + Story File + devLoadAlwaysFiles
- Sharding for large docs
- Story files are self-contained
- Config defines what to load
- No automatic token management
```

**cc10x:**
```
Context = Progressive Loading (3 stages) + Auto-Healing Snapshots
- Stage 1: Metadata only (~50 tokens)
- Stage 2: Relevant context (~500 tokens)
- Stage 3: On-demand details (variable)
- Auto-snapshot at 75% tokens
- Hooks manage lifecycle
```

**Winner**: **cc10x** - Most sophisticated token management and auto-healing

---

## 5. What cc10x Already Does Better

### 5.1 TDD Enforcement

**Spec Kit**: Mentioned in constitution as "Test-First Imperative" but not enforced in commands
**BMAD**: Optional, dev agent can choose to write tests
**cc10x**: **MANDATORY** - No production code without failing test first

```typescript
// cc10x enforces this cycle:
RED: Write failing test
  ↓ Gate: Test MUST fail (if passes, test is wrong)
GREEN: Minimal code to pass
  ↓ Gate: Test MUST pass + all existing tests pass
REFACTOR: Clean up
  ↓ Gate: All tests still pass
```

### 5.2 Token Efficiency

**Spec Kit**: No explicit optimization
**BMAD**: Sharding reduces token usage
**cc10x**: **93% savings** through progressive loading

```
Without Progressive Loading: 15,000 tokens
With Progressive Loading:    1,000 tokens
Savings:                     93%
```

### 5.3 Parallel Execution

**Spec Kit**: Sequential commands, [P] markers in tasks (for parallel team work)
**BMAD**: Sequential (SM → Dev → QA cycle)
**cc10x**: **PARALLEL** - 5 simultaneous reviewers

```
Traditional: Security → Quality → Performance → UX → A11y (serial)
cc10x:      Security + Quality + Performance + UX + A11y (parallel)

Time savings: 5x faster reviews
```

### 5.4 Auto-Healing

**Spec Kit**: No context preservation
**BMAD**: Manual (user manages context)
**cc10x**: **AUTOMATIC** - Snapshots at 75% tokens

```bash
# cc10x pre-compact hook automatically:
1. Creates comprehensive snapshot
2. Saves session state
3. Preserves working plan
4. Enables seamless continuation
```

---

## 6. What cc10x Could Learn

### 6.1 From Spec Kit

#### Constitutional Framework (Maybe)

**Pattern:**
```markdown
# memory/constitution.md

Article I: Library-First Principle
  Every feature MUST begin as standalone library

Article III: Test-First Imperative (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  No code without failing test first

Article VII: Simplicity Gate
  Maximum 3 projects for initial implementation
```

**cc10x Equivalent:**
Could create `.claude/memory/CONSTITUTION.md` with:
- TDD enforcement rules
- File size limits (500 lines)
- Quality standards
- Production-readiness requirements

**Assessment**: ❓ Interesting but may be overkill - cc10x already enforces through commands

#### Cross-Artifact Analysis (Maybe)

**Pattern:** `/speckit.analyze` validates spec + plan + tasks for:
- Duplications
- Ambiguities
- Constitution violations
- Coverage gaps
- Inconsistencies

**cc10x Equivalent:**
Could add `/validate` command that checks:
- Feature plan vs actual code
- Tests cover all requirements
- No contradictions in documentation

**Assessment**: ✅ **GOOD IDEA** - Could enhance quality

### 6.2 From BMAD METHOD

#### Risk Profiling (Definitely)

**Pattern:** QA's `*risk` command assesses before development:
```yaml
risk_id: security-auth-bypass
category: Security
description: JWT validation could be bypassed
probability: 3 (medium)
impact: 3 (high)
score: 9 (probability × impact)
mitigation: Add comprehensive token validation tests
```

**cc10x Enhancement:**
Add risk assessment to `/feature-plan` Phase 3:
```
Phase 3a: Edge Case Identification
Phase 3b: Risk Assessment (NEW)
  - Security risks
  - Performance risks
  - Data integrity risks
  - Mitigation strategies
```

**Assessment**: ✅ **EXCELLENT IDEA** - Would improve planning quality

#### Story Template Pattern (Partial)

**Pattern:** BMAD's story files are YAML-templated with:
```yaml
sections:
  - id: dev-notes
    instruction: Include ALL context
  - id: tasks-subtasks
    type: bullet-list
  - id: dev-agent-record
    owner: dev-agent
```

**cc10x Equivalent:**
Feature plans could use more structured templates with:
- Clearer ownership sections
- Change tracking
- Agent record sections

**Assessment**: ❓ Interesting but adds complexity - cc10x's markdown is simpler

#### Config File Pattern (Maybe)

**Pattern:** BMAD's `core-config.yaml`:
```yaml
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
prd:
  prdFile: docs/prd.md
  prdSharded: true
```

**cc10x Equivalent:**
Could create `.claude/config.yaml`:
```yaml
progressive_loading:
  stage1_files: [CONSTITUTION.md]
  stage2_patterns: ["*.skill.md"]
hooks:
  session_start: hooks/session-start.sh
  pre_compact: hooks/pre-compact.sh

## 8. Command Documentation Quality

### 8.1 Documentation Size

| Project | Avg Command Size | Examples | Workflows | Troubleshooting |
|---------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Spec Kit** | ~8,000 bytes | In README | Yes (diagrams) | Basic |
| **BMAD** | ~7,000 bytes (tasks) | In user guide | Yes (Mermaid) | Good |
| **cc10x** | **~21,000 bytes** | **3+ per command** | **Yes** (detailed) | **Comprehensive** |

**Winner**: **cc10x** - Most comprehensive command documentation

### 8.2 Example Quality

**Spec Kit Examples:**
- Mostly in README.md
- Generic (Taskify photo albums)
- Limited to quickstart

**BMAD Examples:**
- In user-guide.md and agent files
- Detailed workflow diagrams
- Expansion packs show different domains

**cc10x Examples:**
- **3+ per command** (authentication, real-time, payments)
- Input → Process → Output format
- Edge cases covered
- Time estimates included

**Winner**: **cc10x** - More examples, better format

## 9. Workflow Efficiency Comparison

### Time to First Code

**Spec Kit:**
```
Constitution (30 min) → Specify (15 min) → Clarify (15 min) →
Plan (30 min) → Tasks (15 min) → Analyze (10 min) = 1.75 hours
```

**BMAD:**
```
Brief (30 min) → PRD (1 hour) → Architecture (1 hour) →
Shard (30 min) → Story Draft (30 min) = 3.5 hours
```

**cc10x:**
```
Feature Plan (30-60 min) = 0.5-1 hour
(Can skip if simple and go straight to feature-build)
```

**Winner**: **cc10x** - Fastest to code (but less detailed planning)

### Implementation Control

**Spec Kit:**
- Constitution provides governance
- Templates provide structure
- Analyze provides validation

**BMAD:**
- Story files provide ALL context
- QA provides quality gates
- Sequential control (one story at a time)

**cc10x:**
- Quality gates between phases
- TDD cycle enforced per increment
- Parallel review before commit

**Winner**: **cc10x** - Strictest enforcement, most automated

## 11. Recommendations for cc10x

### High Priority (Should Add)

1. ✅ **Risk Assessment in Planning**
   - Add to `/feature-plan` Phase 3
   - Inspired by BMAD's `*risk` command
   - Assess: Security, Performance, Data, Technical risks
   - Include mitigation strategies

2. ✅ **Cross-Artifact Validation** (Maybe as new command)
   - Inspired by Spec Kit's `/speckit.analyze`
   - Add `/validate` command
   - Check plan vs code consistency
   - Identify coverage gaps

### Medium Priority (Consider)

3. ❓ **Constitution Pattern**
   - Create `.claude/memory/CONSTITUTION.md`
   - Document cc10x principles
   - Reference in commands
   - Assessment: Interesting but may not be necessary

4. ❓ **Config File**
   - Create `.claude/config.yaml`
   - Allow customization of paths, thresholds
   - Assessment: Nice to have, not critical

### Low Priority (Interesting but Not Needed)

5. ❌ **Document Sharding** - Progressive loading already solves this
6. ❌ **Two-Environment Workflow** - Unnecessary complexity for cc10x
7. ❌ **Expansion Packs** - Out of scope (software-focused)
