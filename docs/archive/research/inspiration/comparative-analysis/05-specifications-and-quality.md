## 2. Quality Gate Comparison

### 2.1 Spec Kit Quality Gates

**Constitutional Gates:**
```markdown
# plan-template.md

## Phase -1: Pre-Implementation Gates

### Simplicity Gate (Article VII)
- [ ] Using ≤3 projects?
- [ ] No future-proofing?

### Anti-Abstraction Gate (Article VIII)
- [ ] Using framework directly?
- [ ] Single model representation?

### Integration-First Gate (Article IX)
- [ ] Contracts defined?
- [ ] Contract tests written?
```

**Analyze Command:**
```markdown
# /speckit.analyze (read-only validation)

Detects:
- Duplications (near-duplicate requirements)
- Ambiguities (vague adjectives, placeholders)
- Underspecification (missing measurable outcomes)
- Constitution Alignment (violations of MUST principles)
- Coverage Gaps (requirements without tasks)
- Inconsistencies (terminology drift, conflicts)

Severity: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW

Output: Analysis report (no modifications)
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Constitutional enforcement
- ✅ Cross-artifact validation
- ✅ Prevents over-engineering

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ No TDD enforcement
- ❌ No automated review
- ❌ Manual quality checks

### 2.2 BMAD Quality Gates

**QA Agent Commands:**
```yaml
1. *risk-profile {story}
   - Assess risks BEFORE development
   - Categories: Technical, Security, Performance, Data
   - Scoring: Probability × Impact (1-9 scale)
   - Output: Risk assessment markdown

2. *test-design {story}
   - Create test strategy BEFORE development
   - Test scenarios for each AC
   - Priority levels (P0/P1/P2)
   - Output: Test design markdown

3. *trace {story}
   - Map requirements to tests DURING development
   - Given-When-Then format
   - Coverage gap identification
   - Output: Traceability matrix

4. *nfr-assess {story}
   - Validate NFRs DURING development
   - Core Four: Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability
   - Evidence-based validation
   - Output: NFR assessment markdown

5. *review {story}
   - Comprehensive review AFTER development
   - Requirements traceability
   - Code quality review + active refactoring
   - Test architecture assessment
   - Output: QA Results in story + gate file

6. *gate {story}
   - Update quality gate decision
   - Status: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED
   - Output: YAML gate file
```

**Gate Decision Criteria:**
```yaml
# Deterministic rules
FAIL: 
  - Risk score ≥ 9
  - Critical security/data issues
  - P0 test missing
  - High-severity issues

CONCERNS:
  - Risk score ≥ 6
  - P0 test missing (non-critical)
  - Medium-severity issues

PASS:
  - All critical requirements met
  - No blocking issues

WAIVED:
  - Issues acknowledged but accepted
  - Requires: reason, approver, expiry date
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Most comprehensive QA system
- ✅ Risk-based approach
- ✅ Advisory (doesn't block arbitrarily)
- ✅ Active refactoring (QA improves code)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ No TDD enforcement
- ❌ Sequential (one story at a time)
- ❌ User must invoke each QA command

### 2.3 cc10x Quality Gates

**Multi-Level Gates:**

**Per-Phase Gates:**
```
Phase 1 Gate (Context Analysis):
  ✅ Patterns identified
  ✅ Integration points mapped

Phase 2 Gate (Planning):
  ✅ Feature decomposed into increments
  ✅ TDD approach defined

Phase 3 Gate (Implementation - per increment):
  ✅ Test written FIRST
  ✅ Test fails correctly (RED)
  ✅ Code makes test pass (GREEN)
  ✅ All tests pass
  ✅ Coverage > 80%
  ✅ No linting errors
  ✅ No debug code

Phase 4 Gate (Verification):
  ✅ No critical security issues
  ✅ No major quality issues
  ✅ No critical accessibility issues
  ⚠️ Performance warnings acknowledged
  ⚠️ UX warnings acknowledged

Phase 5 Gate (Finalization):
  ✅ Changes staged correctly
  ✅ Semantic commit message
  ✅ No sensitive data
```

**TDD Cycle Gates:**
```
RED Gate:
  ✅ Test written
  ✅ Test MUST fail
  ❌ If test passes, test is wrong → Fix test

GREEN Gate:
  ✅ Minimal code written
  ✅ Test MUST pass
  ✅ ALL existing tests MUST still pass
  ❌ If any test breaks → Fix immediately

REFACTOR Gate:
  ✅ Code improved (optional)
  ✅ All tests MUST still pass
  ❌ If tests break → Revert refactoring
```

**Multi-Dimensional Review:**
```
5 PARALLEL reviewers:
  security-reviewer → BLOCKS if critical
  quality-reviewer → BLOCKS if major
  performance-analyzer → WARNS (can defer)
  ux-reviewer → WARNS (can defer)
  accessibility-reviewer → BLOCKS if critical
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Strictest TDD** (mandatory at every increment)
- ✅ **Multi-level** (phase + increment + TDD cycle)
- ✅ **Automated** (no manual invocation)
- ✅ **Parallel** (5 simultaneous reviewers)
- ✅ **Blocking vs Warning** (smart prioritization)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ No risk profiling (could add from BMAD)
- ❌ No test design command (embedded in workflow)

## 3. Implementation Patterns

### 3.1 Spec Kit Implementation

**Approach:** Task-based with constitution compliance

```markdown
# tasks.md

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure
- [ ] T002 Initialize dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure tools

## Phase 2: Foundational (BLOCKING)
- [ ] T004 Database schema
- [ ] T005 [P] Auth framework
- [ ] T006 [P] API routing
CHECKPOINT: Foundation ready

## Phase 3: User Story 1
### Tests (OPTIONAL - only if requested)
- [ ] T010 [P] Contract test
- [ ] T011 [P] Integration test

### Implementation
- [ ] T012 [P] Create Model1
- [ ] T013 [P] Create Model2
- [ ] T014 Implement Service
CHECKPOINT: Story 1 functional
```

**Characteristics:**
- [P] markers for parallel tasks
- User story-based phases
- Tests OPTIONAL (only if requested)
- Checkpoints for validation
- File paths specified

### 3.2 BMAD Implementation

**Approach:** Story-centric with full context

```markdown
# Story 1.3: User Login

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create User model (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Define schema
  - [ ] Add validation
  - [ ] Write unit tests
  
- [ ] Task 2: Create Auth service (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement login method
  - [ ] Add JWT generation
  - [ ] Write service tests

## Dev Notes (COMPLETE CONTEXT)
### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
[Complete schema details]

### API Spec [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md#auth]
[Complete API details]

### File Locations
[Exact paths]

### Testing Requirements [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
[Specific test cases]
```

**Dev Agent Workflow:**
```
1. Read story file only (has all context)
2. Read devLoadAlwaysFiles (coding-standards, tech-stack)
3. Implement Task 1
4. Check box: [x]
5. Implement Task 2
6. Check box: [x]
7. Update File List
8. Set status: Review
```

**Characteristics:**
- Story is self-contained
- Source citations for all details
- Dev Agent Record tracks progress
- Checkbox-based tracking

### 3.3 cc10x Implementation

**Approach:** TDD-enforced increments with strict gates

```markdown
# /feature-build workflow

Phase 3: Implementation

For each increment (<200 lines):
  
  Increment N:
    Step 1: RED - Write Failing Test
      ├─> Write test defining desired behavior
      ├─> Run test → MUST FAIL
      └─> Gate: If passes, test is wrong
    
    Step 2: GREEN - Make It Pass
      ├─> Write MINIMUM code to pass
      ├─> Run test → MUST PASS
      ├─> Run ALL tests → MUST ALL PASS
      └─> Gate: If any break, fix immediately
    
    Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve Quality
      ├─> Improve structure (optional)
      ├─> Run ALL tests → MUST STILL PASS
      └─> Gate: If tests break, revert
    
    Step 4: Verify Increment
      ├─> Coverage >80%
      ├─> No linting errors
      ├─> No debug code
      └─> Gate: All checks pass
    
    Step 5: Next Increment
      └─> Only after current complete
```

**Characteristics:**
- Mandatory TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Per-increment gates
- Small increments (<200 lines)
- Automatic verification

## 4. Quality Enforcement Comparison

| Feature | Spec Kit | BMAD METHOD | cc10x |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **TDD Enforcement** | Mentioned in constitution | Optional | **STRICT (mandatory)** |
| **Test-First** | Recommended | Optional | **ENFORCED** |
| **Coverage Target** | Not specified | Not specified | **>80% required** |
| **Quality Checks** | Constitutional gates | QA agent (6 commands) | Multi-dimensional review |
| **Automated Review** | analyze command | QA *review task | **5 parallel reviewers** |
| **Code Refactoring** | Manual | **QA can refactor** | Manual |
| **Gate Blocking** | Advisory | Advisory | **Mandatory** |
| **Parallel Analysis** | No | No | **Yes (5 reviewers)** |

**Winner: cc10x** - Strictest enforcement, most automated, mandatory gates

---

## 5. What cc10x Already Does Better

### 5.1 TDD Enforcement

**Spec Kit:**
- Constitution mentions test-first
- Not enforced in commands
- Tests optional in tasks.md

**BMAD:**
- Testing mentioned in guidelines
- Not enforced
- Dev can skip tests

**cc10x:**
```
MANDATORY TDD CYCLE:
❌ NO production code without failing test first
✅ If test passes without code → test is wrong
✅ If existing tests break → fix immediately
✅ Coverage must be >80%
```

**Enforcement:** cc10x is only system that **BLOCKS** code without tests

### 5.2 Quality Review Automation

**Spec Kit:** `/speckit.analyze` (read-only report)
**BMAD:** `@qa *review` (user invokes, sequential)
**cc10x:** `/review` (automatic, 5 parallel reviewers)

**Speed Comparison:**
```
Spec Kit: Single analysis pass
BMAD: Sequential QA review
cc10x: 5 SIMULTANEOUS reviewers

Time: cc10x is 5x faster
```

### 5.3 Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**Spec Kit:** Single consistency check
**BMAD:** QA covers security, performance, reliability, maintainability
**cc10x:** **5 SPECIALIZED REVIEWERS:**
  1. Security (OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities)
  2. Quality (code smells, maintainability)
  3. Performance (N+1 queries, bottlenecks)
  4. UX (error messages, loading states)
  5. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Breadth:** cc10x has widest coverage

---

## 6. What cc10x Could Learn

### 6.1 From Spec Kit: Constitution Pattern

**Already recommended in Iteration 3**

Create `.claude/memory/CONSTITUTION.md`:
```markdown
# cc10x Development Constitution

## Article I: Test-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)
NO production code shall be written before:
1. A test is written that defines the behavior
2. The test is confirmed to FAIL (Red phase)
3. User or automated gate approves proceeding

Violations: Code must be deleted, process restarted.

## Article II: File Size Limits
- Components: Maximum 200 lines
- Services: Maximum 400 lines
- Utilities: Maximum 300 lines
- Configuration: Maximum 100 lines

Violations: File must be split immediately.

## Article III: Progressive Quality Gates
All implementation phases must pass quality gates:
- Context Analysis Gate
- Planning Gate
- Per-Increment Gates (TDD cycle)
- Verification Gate
- Finalization Gate

Violations: Cannot proceed to next phase.

## Article IV: Production-Ready Only
NO incomplete implementations:
- No placeholders or TODOs
- No "You would need to..."
- Complete working code only

## Article V: Multi-Dimensional Review
Before merge, code must be reviewed across:
- Security (critical issues block)
- Quality (major issues block)
- Performance (warnings acceptable)
- UX (warnings acceptable)
- Accessibility (critical issues block)
```

**Value:** Formalizes existing cc10x practices

### 6.2 From BMAD: Risk Profiling

**Add to `/feature-plan` Phase 3:**

```markdown
## Phase 3b: Risk Assessment (NEW)

Process:
1. Identify risks:
   - Security risks (auth, data, injection)
   - Performance risks (N+1, bottlenecks)
   - Data integrity risks (loss, corruption)
   - Technical risks (dependencies, complexity)

2. Score each risk:
   - Probability (1-3): Low/Medium/High
   - Impact (1-3): Low/Medium/High
   - Score: Probability × Impact (1-9)

3. Prioritize:
   - Score 7-9: HIGH (address in planning)
   - Score 4-6: MEDIUM (mitigate in implementation)
   - Score 1-3: LOW (acceptable)

4. Mitigation strategies:
   - For HIGH risks: Include in implementation plan
   - For MEDIUM: Add to testing strategy
   - For LOW: Document and accept

Output:
## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| JWT bypass | Security | 2 | 3 | 6 | Comprehensive token validation tests |
| N+1 queries | Performance | 3 | 2 | 6 | Use JOINs, add indexes |
```

**Value:** HIGH - Would significantly improve planning quality

---

## 7. Specification Quality Comparison

| Aspect | Spec Kit | BMAD | cc10x |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **Formality** | High (constitutional) | High (structured YAML) | Medium (pragmatic) |
| **Detail Level** | Medium (spec only) | **High** (PRD + Arch) | Medium (feature plan) |
| **Tech Stack** | Separate (in plan) | In Technical Assumptions | **In feature plan** |
| **Architecture** | In plan | **Separate doc** | In feature plan |
| **Test Strategy** | In tasks | In story Testing section | **In feature plan** |
| **Implementation Plan** | In tasks.md | In story Tasks | **In feature plan (roadmap)** |
| **Context Analysis** | Manual | Manual | **Automatic** |

### 7.1 Granularity Comparison

**Spec Kit:**
```
Spec (what, why) →
  Plan (how, tech stack) →
    Tasks (step-by-step)

3 documents, clear separation
```

**BMAD:**
```
Brief →
  PRD (goals, FRs, NFRs, epics) →
    Architecture (tech, design, patterns) →
      Epic (group of stories) →
        Story (detailed implementation guide)

5 levels, maximum detail
```

**cc10x:**
```
Feature Plan (what, why, how, architecture, API, data, tests, roadmap)

1 document, comprehensive
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Spec Kit: Best separation of concerns
- BMAD: Most detailed planning
- cc10x: **Most pragmatic** (all-in-one, ready to build)

---

## 8. Recommendations for cc10x

### High Priority

1. ✅ **Add Risk Assessment** (from BMAD QA)
   - Include in `/feature-plan` Phase 3
   - Risk matrix with scoring
   - Mitigation strategies
   - **Value**: HIGH

2. ✅ **Add Constitution** (from Spec Kit)
   - Formalize cc10x principles
   - `.claude/memory/CONSTITUTION.md`
   - Reference in commands
   - **Value**: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Medium Priority

3. ❓ **Add Validation Command** (inspired by Spec Kit's analyze)
   - `/validate` - Check plan vs implementation
   - Detect inconsistencies
   - Verify coverage
   - **Value**: MEDIUM

### Not Needed

4. ❌ **Separate Architecture Doc** - Included in feature plan works better
5. ❌ **Document Sharding** - Progressive loading is superior
6. ❌ **More Documentation Levels** - Current approach is optimal
