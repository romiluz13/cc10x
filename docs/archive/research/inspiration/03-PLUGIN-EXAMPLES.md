## 4. Skills Powerkit (jeremylongshore)

**Repository:** jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus/plugins/skill-enhancers/skills-powerkit
**Type:** Agent Skills plugin (first of its kind)
**Components:** 5 Agent Skills
**Status:** Production (October 2025 release)

### Structure

```
skills-powerkit/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  skills/
    plugin-creator/
      SKILL.md
    plugin-validator/
      SKILL.md
    marketplace-manager/
      SKILL.md
    plugin-auditor/
      SKILL.md
    version-bumper/
      SKILL.md
  README.md
```

### plugin.json

```json
{
  "name": "skills-powerkit",
  "description": "First Agent Skills plugin - auto-scaffolds plugins, validates structure, manages catalog, audits security, handles versions",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Jeremy Longshore",
    "url": "https://github.com/jeremylongshore"
  },
  "category": "productivity",
  "keywords": ["agent-skills", "plugin-development", "automation"],
  "skills": "./skills/"
}
```

### Skill Example: plugin-creator/SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: "Plugin Creator"
description: |
  Automatically scaffolds Claude Code plugins when user mentions
  "create a plugin" or needs plugin structure. Auto-invoked
  for plugin development tasks.
---

## What This Skill Does

Automatically creates complete plugin structure including:
- .claude-plugin/plugin.json with metadata
- commands/ directory with template
- agents/ directory with template
- README.md with usage instructions
- Proper YAML frontmatter
- Installation instructions

## When It Activates

- User says "create a plugin"
- User mentions "scaffold plugin"
- User asks "how to make a plugin"
- Context involves plugin development

## How It Works

1. Asks for plugin details (name, description, purpose)
2. Creates directory structure
3. Generates plugin.json with metadata
4. Creates command/agent templates
5. Writes comprehensive README
6. Provides installation instructions

[... more details ...]
```

### Revolutionary Pattern

**Auto-Activation:**
- No slash command needed
- Claude detects intent from conversation
- "Create a plugin" → Skill activates
- Natural language interface

**Complete Workflow:**
- One skill = complete capability
- No manual steps
- Best practices built-in
- Production-ready output

## 5. project-health-auditor (MCP Server Plugin)

**Repository:** jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus/plugins/mcp/project-health-auditor
**Type:** MCP Server (executable code)
**Components:** 4 MCP tools
**Status:** Production

### Structure

```
project-health-auditor/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  src/
    index.ts              # Main MCP server
    complexity.ts         # Complexity analysis
    churn.ts              # Git churn analysis
    tests.ts              # Test mapping
    hotspots.ts           # Hot spot detection
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  README.md
```

### plugin.json

```json
{
  "name": "project-health-auditor",
  "description": "Code health analysis: complexity + churn + tests",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Jeremy Longshore"
  },
  "mcp": {
    "server": "./dist/index.js",
    "tools": [
      "list_repo_files",
      "file_metrics",
      "git_churn",
      "map_tests"
    ]
  }
}
```

### MCP Tools

**1. list_repo_files**
- Scans repository for code files
- Filters by language
- Returns file paths

**2. file_metrics**
- Calculates cyclomatic complexity
- Lines of code
- Function count
- Health score

**3. git_churn**
- Analyzes git history
- Identifies frequently changed files
- Calculates churn score

**4. map_tests**
- Maps source files to test files
- Identifies test coverage gaps
- Reports untested code

### Key Difference

**Executable Code:**
- Runs as Node.js process
- Claude calls via MCP protocol
- Actual computation happens in TypeScript
- More powerful than instructions alone

**When to Use:**
- Complex calculations
- File system operations
- External API calls
- Heavy processing

---

## Common Success Patterns

### 1. Clear Purpose
All successful plugins:
- Do one thing well
- Clear value proposition
- Obvious use case
- No feature creep

### 2. Proper Structure
Standard layout:
```
plugin-name/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  commands/         # Optional
  agents/           # Optional
  skills/           # Optional
  hooks/            # Optional
  README.md
  LICENSE
```

### 3. Rich Metadata
plugin.json includes:
- Descriptive name
- Clear description
- Author info
- Keywords
- Version
- License
- Homepage/repository

### 4. Quality Documentation
README contains:
- What it does
- When to use
- How to install
- Usage examples
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting

### 5. Component Specifications

**Commands:**
```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: What it does
---
# Instructions
```

**Agents:**
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Agent role
tools: ["tool1", "tool2"]
---
# Agent prompt
```

**Skills:**
```markdown
---
name: "Skill Name"
description: |
  When to use, trigger phrases
---
# Skill instructions
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Missing Metadata:**
- No description
- No author
- No version
- No keywords

❌ **Poor Organization:**
- Files in wrong directories
- Inconsistent naming
- Missing YAML frontmatter
- No clear structure

❌ **Vague Purpose:**
- Does too many things
- Unclear use case
- No examples
- Poor documentation

❌ **Incomplete Implementation:**
- Placeholder content
- TODO comments
- Broken examples
- Missing features

---

## Recommended Patterns

### For Single Command Plugins
```
plugin-name/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  commands/
    main-command.md
  README.md
  LICENSE
```

### For Agent Collections
```
plugin-name/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  agents/
    agent-1.md
    agent-2.md
    agent-3.md
  README.md
```

### For Comprehensive Orchestration
```
plugin-name/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  commands/
    workflow-1.md
    workflow-2.md
  agents/
    specialist-1.md
    specialist-2.md
  skills/
    skill-1/SKILL.md
    skill-2/SKILL.md
  hooks/
    hooks.json
    session-start.sh
  README.md
```

---

## Lessons for cc10x

**Current cc10x matches "Comprehensive Orchestration" pattern:**
- 4 commands (workflows)
- 7 agents (specialists)
- 16 skills (domain expertise)
- Hooks (automation)

**Best Matches:**
1. **compounding-engineering** - Similar philosophy and structure
2. **experienced-engineer** - Team-focused toolkit
3. **Skills Powerkit** - Modern agent skills approach

**Recommendation:**
- Follow compounding-engineering structure
- Single plugin, not marketplace
- Rich metadata
- Excellent documentation
- Clear installation path
