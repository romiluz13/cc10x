## Act 1: Introduction (1 minute)

### [Screen: cc10x GitHub README]

**Voiceover:**
> "Hi, I'm going to show you cc10x - a Claude Code plugin that makes you 10 times more productive through intelligent orchestration.

> Unlike other development tools, cc10x combines four powerful workflows: comprehensive feature planning, TDD-enforced development, systematic debugging, and multi-dimensional code review.

> But what makes cc10x truly special are three unique capabilities: 93% token efficiency through progressive loading, automatic context preservation at 75%, and the industry's strictest TDD enforcement. Let me show you how it works."

### Visual Actions:
1. Show cc10x README header
2. Scroll to show 4 commands
3. Highlight key features section

**Timing:** 0:00 - 1:00

---

## Act 2: Installation (1 minute)

### [Screen: Terminal]

**Voiceover:**
> "Installation takes just one minute. Open Claude Code and run two commands.

> First, add the cc10x marketplace. Then install the plugin.

> That's it. cc10x is now active with all four commands available."

### Visual Actions:
```bash
# Type these commands
/plugin marketplace add romiluz13/cc10x
/plugin install cc10x@romiluz13-cc10x

# Show success message
# Type to verify
/feature-plan
```

**Timing:** 1:00 - 2:00

---

## Act 3: Feature Planning Demo (2 minutes)

### [Screen: Claude Code with cc10x]

**Voiceover:**
> "Let's plan a real feature: user authentication with JWT tokens.

> Watch how cc10x orchestrates comprehensive planning through five phases.

> Phase 1: Requirements gathering - cc10x extracts core functionality and assumptions.

> Phase 2: Context analysis - it searches our codebase for similar patterns and finds existing auth middleware and validation patterns.

> Phase 3: Architecture and design - cc10x creates user stories with acceptance criteria, proposes JWT-based stateless authentication, designs components, specifies API endpoints, and defines data models.

> Here's something unique to cc10x: Phase 3b - Risk Assessment. Inspired by BMAD METHOD, cc10x identifies security, performance, and data risks BEFORE implementation, scores them by probability times impact, and defines mitigation strategies.

> Phase 4: Testing strategy - plans unit, integration, and E2E tests.

> Phase 5: Implementation roadmap - breaks the feature into phases with time estimates.

> The result is a comprehensive plan ready for implementation."

### Visual Actions:
```bash
# Type command
/feature-plan User authentication with JWT tokens

# Show each phase appearing
[Phase 1: Requirements]
- Core Need: JWT authentication
- Primary Users: Web app users
- Key Flows: Login, register, logout

[Phase 2: Context Analysis]
- Found: src/middleware/auth.ts pattern
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

[Phase 3: Architecture]
- User stories with AC
- JWT-based approach
- Components: AuthController, AuthMiddleware, User Model
- API endpoints with request/response
- Data models with schemas

[Phase 3b: Risk Assessment] <-- HIGHLIGHT THIS
- R-001: JWT bypass (Score: 6) → Mitigation
- R-002: N+1 queries (Score: 6) → Mitigation

[Phase 4: Testing Strategy]
- Unit tests: AuthController methods
- Integration: API endpoints
- E2E: Full auth flow

[Phase 5: Implementation Roadmap]
- Phase 1: Database setup (30 min)
- Phase 2: Auth service (1 hour)
- Phase 3: API endpoints (1 hour)
```

**Timing:** 2:00 - 4:00

---

## Act 4: Feature Building Demo (3 minutes)

### [Screen: Continue in Claude Code]

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let's build the feature. cc10x orchestrates five phases with strict TDD enforcement.

> Phase 1: Context Analysis - cc10x automatically finds authentication patterns in our codebase to follow.

> Phase 2: Planning - breaks the feature into increments under 200 lines each.

> Phase 3: Implementation - here's where cc10x shines. Watch the TDD cycle.

> RED: cc10x writes a failing test first. It runs the test to confirm it fails - if it passes without code, the test is wrong.

> GREEN: Now cc10x writes minimal code to make the test pass. It runs ALL tests to ensure nothing broke.

> REFACTOR: cc10x cleans up the code while keeping all tests green.

> This cycle repeats for every increment. No production code without a failing test first - this is enforced, not suggested.

> Phase 4: Verification - here cc10x does something no other system does. Five specialized reviewers analyze the code simultaneously.

> Security reviewer checks for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Quality reviewer finds code smells. Performance analyzer detects N+1 queries. UX reviewer evaluates error messages. Accessibility reviewer ensures WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

> All five run in parallel - five times faster than sequential review.

> Phase 5: Finalization - cc10x removes all debug code and generates a clean semantic commit message."

### Visual Actions:
```bash
# Type command
/feature-build Implement user authentication from the plan

# Show phases
[Phase 1: Context Analysis]
✓ Found pattern: bcrypt for password hashing
✓ Found pattern: JWT verification in middleware

[Phase 2: Planning]
✓ Increment 1: User model and schema (150 lines)
✓ Increment 2: Auth service (180 lines)
✓ Increment 3: API routes (120 lines)

[Phase 3: Implementation - Increment 1]

RED: Write failing test
```typescript
test('User.create should hash password', async () => {
  const user = await User.create({
    email: 'test@example.com',
    password: 'plaintext'
  });
  expect(user.password).not.toBe('plaintext');
  expect(await bcrypt.compare('plaintext', user.password)).toBe(true);
});
```
❌ Test fails (good!)

GREEN: Write code
```typescript
userSchema.pre('save', async function() {
  if (this.isModified('password')) {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 12);
  }
});
```
✓ Test passes!
✓ All tests pass!

REFACTOR: Clean up
```typescript
// Extract hash rounds to constant
const HASH_ROUNDS = 12;
userSchema.pre('save', async function() {
  if (this.isModified('password')) {
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, HASH_ROUNDS);
  }
});
```
✓ Tests still pass!

[Phase 4: Verification - 5 PARALLEL REVIEWERS]
✓ Security: No critical issues
✓ Quality: No major code smells
⚠️ Performance: Consider indexing email field (MEDIUM)
✓ UX: Error messages clear
✓ Accessibility: N/A (backend)

[Phase 5: Finalization]
✓ Removed 3 console.log statements
✓ Generated commit: "feat(auth): add user authentication with JWT"
```

**Timing:** 4:00 - 7:00

---

## Act 5: Bug Fixing Demo (2 minutes)

### [Screen: Claude Code]

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let's fix a bug. Users can log in with empty email addresses.

> cc10x uses the LOG FIRST pattern - always understand before fixing.

> Phase 1: Context gathering - what's the bug? What's expected?

> Phase 2: Investigation - here's the key: LOG FIRST. cc10x adds strategic logging BEFORE fixing anything. It reproduces the bug, analyzes the logs, and identifies the root cause.

> Only after understanding the problem does it move to Phase 3.

> Phase 3: Fix implementation - RED: write a test that reproduces the bug. GREEN: minimal fix to pass the test.

> Phase 4: Verification - all tests including regression checks.

> Phase 5: Finalization - and this is important - cc10x removes ALL debug logging it added. No console.log statements left behind."

### Visual Actions:
```bash
# Type command
/bug-fix Users can login with empty email addresses

[Phase 1: Context]
Bug: Empty email accepted
Expected: Email validation required

[Phase 2: Investigation - LOG FIRST]
Adding logging:
```typescript
console.log('[DEBUG] Login attempt:', email, password);
console.log('[DEBUG] Validation result:', validationResult);
```
Reproducing bug...
Logs show: Email validation skipped!

Root cause: Missing validation in login route

[Phase 3: Fix]
RED: Write test
```typescript
test('Login rejects empty email', async () => {
  const res = await request(app)
    .post('/api/auth/login')
    .send({ email: '', password: 'test' });
  expect(res.status).toBe(400);
  expect(res.body.error).toBe('Email required');
});
```
❌ Test fails (reproduces bug)

GREEN: Minimal fix
```typescript
if (!email || email.trim() === '') {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email required' });
}
```
✓ Test passes!
✓ All tests pass!

[Phase 5: Finalization]
✓ Removed ALL debug logging
✓ Commit: "fix(auth): validate email before login"
```

**Timing:** 7:00 - 9:00

---

## Act 6: Code Review Demo (1 minute)

### [Screen: Claude Code]

**Voiceover:**
> "Finally, let's review our authentication code.

> cc10x launches five reviewers simultaneously.

> They analyze security, quality, performance, UX, and accessibility in parallel.

> In seconds, we get a comprehensive report with prioritized findings.

> Critical issues block merge. High issues get recommendations. Medium and low issues are flagged for follow-up.

> This is 70% faster than manual review and catches issues human reviewers miss."

### Visual Actions:
```bash
# Type command
/review src/auth/

[5 PARALLEL REVIEWERS ANALYZING...]

✓ Security Review: 1 MEDIUM issue
  - Token expiry set to 24h (consider refresh tokens)

✓ Quality Review: No major issues
  - Code follows project patterns
  - No code smells detected

✓ Performance Review: 1 MEDIUM issue
  - Add index on User.email for faster lookups

⚠️ UX Review: 1 HIGH issue
  - Error message "Invalid credentials" too generic
  - Recommend: "Email or password incorrect"

✓ Accessibility Review: N/A (backend API)

RESULT: 1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM issues
Recommendation: Fix HIGH before merge
```

**Timing:** 9:00 - 10:00
