## 🔍 Research Phase

### Repositories Analyzed via Octocode

**Successful Plugins with Skills**:
- **superpowers** (4399 stars) - Core skills library
  - Pattern: Commands delegate to skills
  - Example: `/write-plan` → 126 bytes → delegates to `writing-plans` skill
  - Agent descriptions: Include `<example>` tags with context

- **playwright-skill** (450 stars) - Browser automation
  - Structure: Single skill plugin
  - Progressive loading implemented
  - Clean SKILL.md frontmatter

**Marketplace Repositories**:
- **every-marketplace** (405 stars) - Official Every-Env marketplace
  - Structure: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at root
  - Plugins in `./plugins/` subdirectories

- **superpowers-marketplace** (55 stars) - Curated by obra
  - Remote plugin sources via git URLs
  - Uses `source: { source: "url", url: "..." }` pattern

- **claude-code-plugins-plus** (137 stars) - Hub with 227 plugins
  - Complex marketplace with multiple plugin packs
  - Extended marketplace.json format

## 📊 What We Fixed

### Issue #1: Commands Too Large ❌ → ✅

**Before**: Commands contained full orchestration (800+ lines each)
```markdown
# commands/feature-plan.md (806 lines)
---
name: feature-plan
---

# Feature Planning - Strategic Design Before Building

You are orchestrating a comprehensive feature planning workflow...

## Phase 1: Understand the Feature
[500+ lines of orchestration logic]
...
```

**After**: Commands delegate to skills (6 lines each)
```markdown
# commands/feature-plan.md (6 lines)
---
name: feature-plan
description: Create comprehensive feature plan...
---

Use the feature-planning skill exactly as written
```

**Reduction**: 2,056 lines → 24 lines (99% smaller)

### Issue #2: Orchestration in Wrong Place ❌ → ✅

**Before**: Orchestration lived in commands
**After**: Orchestration moved to skills

Created 4 new orchestration skills:
- `skills/feature-planning/SKILL.md` - 6-phase planning workflow
- `skills/feature-building/SKILL.md` - 5-phase implementation workflow
- `skills/bug-fixing/SKILL.md` - LOG FIRST debugging workflow
- `skills/code-reviewing/SKILL.md` - Multi-dimensional parallel review

### Issue #3: Agent Descriptions Missing Examples ❌ → ✅

**Before**: Simple descriptions
```yaml
---
name: implementer
description: Implements features and fixes using TDD methodology
---
```

**After**: Descriptions with examples (superpowers pattern)
```yaml
---
name: implementer
description: Use this agent when implementing features or fixing code. Examples: <example>Context: User has a plan and needs implementation. user: "I've finished planning the authentication feature" assistant: "Let me use the implementer agent to build this with strict TDD" <commentary>The planning is done, now need implementation, so use implementer agent</commentary></example>
---
```

### Issue #4: Skills Explicitly Required ❌ → ✅

**Before**: Agents forced skill usage
```markdown
## Automatic Skills

You MUST use these skills (automatic invocation):
- systematic-debugging
- test-driven-development
```

**After**: Skills are model-invoked
```markdown
## Available Skills

Claude may invoke these skills when relevant:
- systematic-debugging
- test-driven-development

Skills are model-invoked based on context, not explicitly required.
```

### Issue #5: Agent Frontmatter ❌ → ✅

**Before**:
```yaml
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: inherit
```

**After**:
```yaml
# tools field removed (not needed)
model: sonnet
```
