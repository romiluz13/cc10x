## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Review the Changes

```bash
# Check command documentation (now comprehensive!)
cat commands/feature-plan.md      # 20KB of docs

### 2. Skill Trigger Phrases

Check how skills auto-activate:

```bash
# View trigger phrases
grep -A 5 "Trigger phrases:" skills/*/SKILL.md

# You'll see phrases like:
# - "security review" → security-patterns activates
# - "accessibility check" → accessibility-patterns activates
# - "fix bug" → bug-fixing activates
# - "implement feature" → feature-building activates
```

### 3. Enhanced Hooks

## Testing the Enhancements

### Test Commands

**1. Feature Planning:**
```bash
/feature-plan Add user authentication with JWT tokens
```
Should show comprehensive planning with user stories, architecture, API design, etc.

**2. Feature Building:**
```bash
/feature-build Implement simple greeting function with tests
```
Should show 5-phase workflow with TDD enforcement.

**3. Bug Fixing:**
```bash
/bug-fix Form submission not working
```
Should show LOG FIRST pattern and systematic debugging.

**4. Code Review:**
```bash
/review src/
```
Should show multi-dimensional analysis across security, quality, performance, UX, accessibility.

### Test Skill Triggers

Try these phrases and see skills auto-activate:

```
"Check for security vulnerabilities"          → security-patterns
"Review accessibility compliance"              → accessibility-patterns
"This code is too slow"                        → performance-patterns
"Improve the user experience"                  → ux-patterns
"Implement this feature"                       → feature-building
"Debug this issue"                             → bug-fixing
"Review this code"                             → code-reviewing
```

### Test Hooks

**Session Start:**
- Start Claude Code in the project
- Should see comprehensive welcome
- Check `.claude/memory/session.log` for logs

**Pre-Compact:**
- Not easy to test (triggers at 75% tokens)
- Will work automatically when needed
- Creates snapshot in `.claude/memory/snapshots/`
