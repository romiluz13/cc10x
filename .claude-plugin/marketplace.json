      "description": "cc10x v2.2: Pure skill orchestrator with natural language activation. 11 agents + 20 skills coordinate systematically. Say 'review my code' or 'plan this feature' to activate. 4 workflows: REVIEW (5 parallel AI agents), PLANNING (PRD with risk analysis), BUILDING (TDD enforced), DEBUGGING (LOG FIRST). Progressive loading (workflows on-demand) saves 50-75% tokens. THE FOCUS RULE enforced (only executes what you request). Complexity-aware (manual for simple 1-2, systematic for complex 4-5). Honest: 3-20x MORE tokens than manual, use for quality-critical complex features.",
