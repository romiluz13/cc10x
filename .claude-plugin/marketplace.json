      "description": "cc10x v3.2: Intelligent orchestration with progressive skills. Detects intent, applies complexity gates, loads the right workflow, and requires verification evidence before completion. Workflows: REVIEW (coordinated analysis), PLANNING (requirements to architecture/design), BUILD (TDD with review + integration), DEBUG (LOG FIRST + minimal fixes), VALIDATE (plan-code-test-docs alignment). Features: smart memory integration, web-fetch caching, workflow state persistence, deterministic intent mapping, perfect subagent activation logic with conflict prevention.",
