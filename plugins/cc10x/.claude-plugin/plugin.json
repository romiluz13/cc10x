  "description": "Focused orchestrator that does what you ask. 4 core workflows (review, build, fix, validate) that deliver results without losing focus. Smart agent activation (only uses what's needed for your task). Quick mode by default, full systematic only if requested. Review workflow (5-star) finds real issues. Build workflow delivers working code. Fix workflow uses LOG FIRST. User controls the flow, not endless orchestration. Honest: costs more tokens for systematic approach, use when quality matters. Simple tasks stay simple, complex tasks get full support.",
