  "description": "Pure skill orchestrator coordinating 11 agents + 20 domain skills for systematic development. Natural language activation (say 'review my code' or 'plan this feature'). 4 workflows: REVIEW (5 parallel AI agents find security/quality/performance issues), PLANNING (comprehensive PRD with risk analysis), BUILDING (TDD enforced), DEBUGGING (LOG FIRST approach). Progressive loading saves 50-75% tokens (workflows load on-demand). THE FOCUS RULE enforced (only executes what you request, no workflow creep). Complexity-aware (recommends manual for simple features 1-2, systematic for complex 4-5). Honest positioning: costs 3-20x MORE tokens than manual due to systematic analysis, use when preventing architecture mistakes justifies cost. Review workflow always worth it (prevents security breaches).",
