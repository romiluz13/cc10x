  "description": "Intelligent orchestration system with auto-loaded CLAUDE.md guide. 12 specialized agents + 21 progressive skills coordinate systematically. Detects intent from natural language, assesses complexity (1-5), routes to workflows dynamically. Progressive loading (50-75% token savings). 5-agent parallel review (security, quality, performance, UX, accessibility). Complexity gate recommends manual for simple features, systematic for complex. 'What Could Go Wrong' methodology integrated. Workflows: REVIEW (always worth it), PLANNING (comprehensive PRD), BUILDING (TDD with pause points), DEBUGGING (LOG FIRST). Honest about costs (3-20x MORE than manual, use for preventing architecture mistakes).",
