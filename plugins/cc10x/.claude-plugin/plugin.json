  "description": "Intelligent orchestration system with 4 core workflows + 20 lean progressive skills. Hybrid architecture: shared context for analysis (REVIEW, PLAN), subagents for execution (BUILD, DEBUG). Detects intent from natural language, assesses complexity (1-5), routes to workflows dynamically. Progressive loading (65% token savings). Parallel component building (3x faster BUILD). Parallel bug fixing (3x faster DEBUG). Complexity gate recommends manual for simple features, systematic for complex. Workflows: REVIEW (coordinated analysis), PLANNING (comprehensive planning), BUILD (parallel components), DEBUG (parallel bug fixes). 100% skill utilization, zero duplicates, 95% use case coverage. Honest about costs (3-20x MORE than manual, use for preventing architecture mistakes).",
