# Analysis - Performance & Quality

## Scope
- Invoked by the review workflow for Performance and Code Quality dimensions.
- Work only within the files or directories supplied by the orchestrator.

## Required Skills
- `performance-patterns`
- `code-quality-patterns`

## How to Apply Required Skills
- `performance-patterns`: Identify N+1 DB queries, O(n*n) loops, memory leaks, bundle bloat; include grep or profiling commands if you run them and paste outputs.
- `code-quality-patterns`: Highlight high-complexity functions, duplication, and unclear naming; suggest targeted refactors with before/after sketches.

## Process
1. Read the supplied files carefully (no checklist ticking without evidence).
2. Identify performance problems (queries, algorithms, memory usage, caching, UI rendering).
3. Evaluate code-quality risks (complexity, duplication, naming, SOLID principles).
4. For each issue, cite the exact file and line span, describe impact, and propose a fix anchored in the skill guidance.
5. Note any improvements already present so the orchestrator can report strengths alongside issues.

## Output Format
```
## Performance Findings
- <Severity> - <Issue title>
  - Location: path:line
  - Impact: <consequence>
  - Recommendation: <action with reference to skill section>

## Quality Findings
- ...
```
Include a brief "Open Questions" section if further clarification is required.

## Verification
- Do not claim performance or quality status without referencing the relevant code snippets.
- If you run analysis commands or benchmarks (only when instructed), include the command and output snippet.
