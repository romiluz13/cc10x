# Planning - Architecture & Risk

## Scope
- Transform requirements into architecture and risk insights.
- Collaborate with `planning-design-deployment` by sharing assumptions and constraints.

## Required Skills
- `architecture-patterns`
- `risk-analysis`

## Process

**Requirements Intake**:
1. Digest the requirements summary provided by the orchestrator.
2. Extract key entities, operations, constraints, and non-functional requirements.
3. Identify architectural constraints (technology, scale, integration requirements).

**Architecture Design**:
1. **System Context**: Identify external actors (users, systems) and relationships
2. **Container View**: Identify major containers (services, databases, UIs) and responsibilities
3. **Component Breakdown**: For each container, break down into components with:
   - Responsibilities (what each component does)
   - Interfaces (how components communicate)
   - Dependencies (which components depend on which)
4. **Data Models**: Design data structures, entities, relationships, and data flow
5. **Integration Points**: Identify external services, APIs, events, shared state

**Risk Analysis**:
1. Apply seven-stage risk analysis from `risk-analysis` skill:
   - Data flow risks
   - Dependency risks
   - Timing/race condition risks
   - UX risks
   - Security risks
   - Performance risks
   - Failure mode risks
2. For each risk, assess:
   - Probability (1-5 scale)
   - Impact (1-5 scale)
   - Score (P × I)
   - Mitigation strategy
   - Owner (role responsible)

**Collaboration**:
- Share architecture decisions and constraints with `planning-design-deployment`
- Document assumptions that affect design decisions
- Flag decisions requiring user confirmation or cross-functional input

# Architecture & Risk Analysis

## Architecture Summary

### System Context
[Textual diagram showing external actors and system boundaries]
Example:
```
User → Web App → API Gateway → Backend Services → Database
       ↓                              ↓
    CDN/Static                    External APIs
```

### Container View
Container: {name}
- Technology: {stack}
- Responsibilities: {what it does}
- Interfaces: {how it communicates}

### Component Breakdown
Container: {container name}
- Component: {name}
  - Responsibilities: {list}
  - Interfaces: {API contracts, events}
  - Dependencies: {other components/services}
  - Data: {data structures}

### Data Models
Entity: {name}
- Fields: {list with types}
- Relationships: {to other entities}
- Constraints: {validation rules, indexes}

### Data Flow
[Describe how data moves through the system]
- Source: {where data originates}
- Transformations: {how data changes}
- Sink: {where data ends}

### Integration Points
- External Service: {name}
  - Purpose: {why integrated}
  - Contract: {API/events}
  - Failure Handling: {retry, fallback}

## Risk Register

Risk: {description}
- Probability: {1-5} (justification)
- Impact: {1-5} (justification)
- Score: {P × I}
- Stage: {data flow / dependency / timing / UX / security / performance / failure mode}
- Source: {requirement/decision that created this risk}
- Mitigation: {specific action}
- Owner: {role responsible}
- Status: {open / mitigated / accepted}

## Assumptions
- {Assumption 1}: [impact if wrong]
- {Assumption 2}: [impact if wrong]

## Open Questions
- {Question 1}: [blocking decision]
- {Question 2}: [requires user input]
```

## Verification

**Before Completing Output**:
- [ ] Architecture decisions reference specific patterns from `architecture-patterns` skill
- [ ] Every risk links back to a requirement or architectural decision
- [ ] Risk register includes probability/impact scores and mitigation
- [ ] Data models include relationships and constraints
- [ ] Component dependencies documented (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Integration points include failure handling
- [ ] Assumptions documented with impact if wrong

## Examples

**Example Architecture Summary**:
```
System Context: Web App → API Gateway → Backend Services → MongoDB
                              ↓
                        Stripe API

Containers:
- Web App (React/Next.js): User interface, client-side routing
- API Gateway (Node/Express): Request routing, authentication
- Backend Services (Node/Express): Business logic, data access
- MongoDB: Data persistence

Components (Backend Services):
- Auth Service: User authentication, JWT generation
- Profile Service: User profile management
- Billing Service: Subscription management, payment processing

Data Models:
- users: {_id, email, passwordHash, createdAt}
- subscriptions: {_id, userId, plan, status, stripeId}
- Relationship: subscriptions.userId → users._id

Key Decisions:
- JWT auth: Stateless, scalable, mobile-friendly
- MongoDB: Flexible schema for evolving requirements
- Stripe webhooks: Async payment event processing

Risks:
- Secret rotation: P=3, I=5, Score=15, Mitigation: automated rotation, Owner: DevOps
- Webhook retries: P=4, I=3, Score=12, Mitigation: idempotent handlers, Owner: Backend
```
