# Code Review Command

Perform comprehensive multi-dimensional code review with parallel analysis across five critical dimensions: security, quality, performance, UX, and accessibility. Get actionable feedback with prioritized recommendations before merging code.

Perfect for pre-PR reviews, security audits, performance optimization, and maintaining high code quality standards.

## What This Does

This command orchestrates parallel reviews across five dimensions:

- **Security Review** - Identifies vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10 issues, authentication problems
- **Quality Review** - Finds code smells, duplication, maintainability issues
- **Performance Review** - Detects bottlenecks, inefficient algorithms, optimization opportunities
- **UX Review** - Assesses usability, error messages, user feedback, interaction patterns
- **Accessibility Review** - Checks WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Parallel Analysis** - All 5 reviews run simultaneously (fast results)
- ‚úÖ **Prioritized Findings** - Critical ‚Üí High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low ‚Üí Info
- ‚úÖ **Actionable Recommendations** - Not just problems, but solutions
- ‚úÖ **Context-Aware** - Understands your project patterns and constraints
- ‚úÖ **Progressive Reports** - Quick summary first, details on demand

## When to Use

Use `/review` when you need to:

- **Before Pull Request** - Catch issues before code review
- **After Feature Implementation** - Verify quality before merge
- **Security Audit** - Check for vulnerabilities in auth/payment/sensitive code
- **Performance Optimization** - Find bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- **Accessibility Compliance** - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Code Quality Check** - Find refactoring opportunities
- **Pre-Production** - Final check before deployment

**Don't use when:**
- Building features (use `/feature-build` - includes verification)
- Fixing bugs (use `/bug-fix` - includes verification)
- Just planning (use `/feature-plan`)

### Phase 1: Scope Analysis (Automatic)

**Goal:** Understand what code to review

**Process:**
1. **Parse Target**
   - Single file: Review that file
   - Directory: Review all code files in directory
   - Glob pattern: Review matching files
   
2. **Identify File Types**
   - Frontend (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Backend (Node, Python, etc.)
   - Database (SQL, migrations)
   - Styles (CSS, SCSS)
   - Tests (Jest, Pytest, etc.)

3. **Determine Review Dimensions**
   - Security: All code (especially auth, validation, DB queries)
   - Quality: All code
   - Performance: All code (especially loops, queries, renders)
   - UX: Frontend only
   - Accessibility: Frontend only

4. **Load Context**
   - Project patterns
   - Existing issues
   - Dependencies and integrations

**Quality Gate:** Clear understanding of review scope

---

### Phase 2: Parallel Multi-Dimensional Review

**Goal:** Analyze code across all five dimensions simultaneously

**Sub-Agents Dispatched (Parallel):**
1. security-reviewer
2. quality-reviewer
3. performance-analyzer
4. ux-reviewer
5. accessibility-reviewer

**Each reviewer:**
- Analyzes code independently
- Uses specialized skills (security-patterns, performance-patterns, etc.)
- Generates findings with severity
- Provides actionable recommendations

**Quality Gate:** All five reviews complete

---

### Phase 3: Report Compilation

**Goal:** Combine findings into actionable report

**Process:**
1. **Aggregate Findings**
   - Collect from all 5 reviewers
   - Remove duplicates
   - Prioritize by severity

2. **Generate Summary**
   - Overall health score
   - Critical issues count
   - High priority count
   - Medium/Low counts

3. **Structure Report**
   - Executive summary
   - Critical issues (must fix)
   - High priority issues (should fix)
   - Medium issues (consider fixing)
   - Low issues (nice to have)
   - Info/suggestions

4. **Add Recommendations**
   - Quick wins (easy + high impact)
   - Long-term improvements
   - Best practices to adopt

**Quality Gate:** Clear, actionable report generated

---

### üö® CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix)

1. **[SECURITY] Stripe Secret Key in Code**
   - File: src/services/stripe.ts:3
   - Move to environment variable immediately
   - **BLOCKS MERGE**

2. **[PERFORMANCE] No Database Index on payment.userId**
   - File: Database schema
   - Query takes 5+ seconds with 10k+ payments
   - Add index: `CREATE INDEX idx_payments_user_id ON payments(user_id);`
   - **BLOCKS MERGE for production**

---

### üî∏ HIGH Priority (Should Fix)

1. **[SECURITY] No Rate Limiting on Payment Endpoint**
   - Could be abused for card testing
   - Add rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

2. **[QUALITY] processPayment() Function Too Complex**
   - 120 lines, does 8 different things
   - Break into smaller functions

3. **[PERFORMANCE] Not Using Stripe Webhook Efficiently**
   - Polling for status instead of webhook
   - Implement proper webhook handling

---

### Quick Wins (Easy + High Impact)

1. ‚úÖ Add database index (5 min, 100x speedup)
2. ‚úÖ Move Stripe key to env (2 min, critical security fix)
3. ‚úÖ Add rate limiting (15 min, prevents abuse)

---

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours to address all CRITICAL and HIGH issues
**Complexity:** Medium
```

---

### Example 2: Security Audit Only

```bash
/review src/features/auth/ --security-only
```

**Process:**
```
Analyzing scope: src/features/auth/
Running security-focused review...
‚úÖ Security Review complete
```

**Output:**
```
## Security Audit: src/features/auth/

**Overall Security:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (65/100)

### üîí Findings

#### CRITICAL (2)

1. **Passwords Stored Without Salt**
   - File: src/models/user.ts:23
   - Using basic hash instead of bcrypt with salt
   - Vulnerability: Rainbow table attacks possible
   - Fix: Use bcrypt with 12 rounds minimum

2. **No CSRF Protection on State-Changing Endpoints**
   - File: src/routes/auth.ts
   - POST /login, /register, /logout have no CSRF tokens
   - Vulnerability: CSRF attacks possible
   - Fix: Implement CSRF token middleware

#### HIGH (3)

1. **JWT Secret Too Weak**
   - File: .env.example
   - Secret is only 16 characters
   - Vulnerability: Brute force possible
   - Fix: Use 256-bit secret (43+ chars)

2. **No Account Lockout After Failed Attempts**
   - File: src/controllers/auth.ts:45
   - Unlimited login attempts allowed
   - Vulnerability: Brute force attacks
   - Fix: Implement 5 attempts ‚Üí 15 min lockout

3. **Sensitive Data in Logs**
   - File: src/middleware/logging.ts:12
   - Logging full request body (includes passwords!)
   - Vulnerability: Passwords in log files
   - Fix: Sanitize logs, never log passwords/tokens

---

**RECOMMENDATION:** Fix all CRITICAL issues before deploying to production

**Compliance:**
- ‚ùå OWASP Top 10: 3 violations
- ‚ùå PCI DSS: Would fail audit (if handling payments)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GDPR: Password logging is violation

**Time to Fix:** 4-6 hours
```

---

### Example 3: Performance Optimization

**Input:**
```bash
/review src/api/users.ts --performance-only
```

**Output:**
```
## Performance Analysis: src/api/users.ts

**Overall Performance:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS OPTIMIZATION (Score: 45/100)

### ‚ö° Bottlenecks Found

#### CRITICAL Performance Issues

**PERF-01: N+1 Query in getUserWithPosts()**
- **Line:** 34-38
- **Current Performance:** 5,000ms for 100 users
- **Expected:** < 100ms
- **Problem:**
  ```javascript
  const users = await User.find();
  for (let user of users) {
    user.posts = await Post.find({ userId: user.id });  // N+1!
  }
  ```
- **Solution:**
  ```javascript
  const users = await User.find()
    .populate('posts')
    .lean();
  ```
- **Expected Improvement:** 5,000ms ‚Üí 50ms (100x faster)

---

#### HIGH Priority

**PERF-02: Missing Database Index**
- **Table:** users
- **Query:** `WHERE email = '...'` (used in login)
- **Current:** Full table scan (200ms with 10k users)
- **Solution:** `CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);`
- **Expected Improvement:** 200ms ‚Üí 5ms (40x faster)

**PERF-03: Not Using SELECT to Limit Fields**
- **Line:** 12
- **Problem:** `SELECT *` returns all 25 fields (12KB per user)
- **Solution:** Select only needed fields (name, email, avatar)
- **Savings:** 12KB ‚Üí 0.5KB per user (96% reduction)

---

### Optimization Opportunities

**Quick Wins:**
1. Add email index (1 minute, 40x speedup) ‚úÖ
2. Use .populate() instead of loop (5 minutes, 100x speedup) ‚úÖ
3. SELECT specific fields (5 minutes, 96% data reduction) ‚úÖ

**Estimated Total Improvement:** 
- Response time: 5,200ms ‚Üí 55ms (95x faster)
- Data transfer: 12KB ‚Üí 0.5KB per user (96% reduction)

**Implementation Time:** 15 minutes
**Complexity:** Low (simple changes, big impact)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Review Early and Often**
Don't wait until PR is ready. Review during development to catch issues early.

### 2. **Review Before PR, Not After**
Run `/review` before submitting PR. Catching your own issues is faster than reviewer catching them.

### 3. **Fix Critical Issues Immediately**
CRITICAL findings block merge for good reason. Don't ignore them.

### 4. **Prioritize Quick Wins**
Issues marked "Quick Win" are easy + high impact. Fix these first.

### 5. **Don't Review Everything at Once**
For large codebases, review feature-by-feature or directory-by-directory.

### 6. **Use Focused Reviews When Appropriate**
Security audit? Use `--security-only`. Performance issue? Use `--performance-only`.

### 7. **Share Reports with Team**
Review reports are documentation. Share for discussion and knowledge transfer.

### 8. **Track Recurring Issues**
Same type of issue appearing repeatedly? Need to address root cause (training, tooling, etc.).

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: Too many findings, overwhelming

**Symptom:** 50+ issues found, don't know where to start

**Solution:**
1. Filter by CRITICAL only first
2. Then HIGH priority
3. Focus on Quick Wins
4. Create tickets for MEDIUM/LOW to fix later

---

### Issue: False positives

**Symptom:** Review flags something that isn't actually a problem

**Solution:**
1. Review understands most context, but not all
2. If finding is incorrect, document why and ignore
3. Report pattern if it happens repeatedly

---

### Issue: Review says "N/A" for some dimensions

**Symptom:** Accessibility review says "N/A"

**Cause:** Code doesn't involve that dimension (e.g., backend code has no UX/accessibility)

**Solution:** This is correct. Not all dimensions apply to all code.

---

### Issue: Want to review only specific dimension

**Symptom:** Need security audit only, don't care about other dimensions

**Solution:** Use flags (note: this is roadmap feature, currently reviews all dimensions)
```bash
/review src/api/ --security-only
/review src/api/ --performance-only
```

---
