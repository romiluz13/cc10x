# REVIEW Workflow Skill

**Orchestrates comprehensive code review with coordinated multi-dimensional analysis.**

## When to Use

Triggered by user requests:
- "review this code"
- "security audit"
- "code quality check"
- "check for vulnerabilities"
- "audit this component"

## Workflow Overview

**Pattern**: Hybrid (shared context + parallel subagents)
**Skills Loaded**: 2 (risk-analysis, code-quality-patterns)
**Subagents**: 3 (analysis-risk-security, analysis-performance-quality, analysis-ux-accessibility)
**Token Cost**: ~15K tokens (30% savings)
**Time**: ~2-3 minutes (3x faster)
**Complexity Gate**: Skip for <100 lines (suggest manual review)
**Timeout**: 10 minutes (return partial results if exceeded)
**Fallback**: If subagent fails, continue with other subagents

---

## Phase 1: Complexity Gate

**Assess code size and complexity:**

1. **Code Size Check:**
   - < 100 lines: ⚠️ SKIP (suggest manual review)
   - 100-500 lines: ✅ PROCEED (standard review)
   - 500-2000 lines: ✅ PROCEED (standard review)
   - > 2000 lines: ✅ PROCEED (deep review)

2. **If skipped (<100 lines):**
   ```
   "This code is small enough for manual review (< 100 lines).
   Manual review: ~5k tokens, 10 min
   cc10x review: ~15k tokens, 2-3 min

   Recommendation: Use manual review for efficiency.
   Want me to review anyway? (3x more tokens)"
   ```

3. **If proceeding (≥100 lines):**
   - Parse user request for review focus
   - Identify target files/directories
   - Prepare for parallel analysis

4. **Partial Code Review Support:**
   - **Line ranges**: "review lines 50-150 of auth.js"
   - **Functions**: "review the login() function"
   - **Sections**: "review the authentication section"
   - **Files**: "review only src/auth/ directory"
   - **Patterns**: "review all database queries"

   **Handling**:
   - Extract specified code section
   - Adjust complexity assessment
   - Proceed with standard review
   - Note: "Reviewing partial code - full context may be needed"

---

## Phase 2: Load Skills in Shared Context

**Load 2 core skills for coordination:**

1. **risk-analysis**
   - Identifies architectural risks
   - Assesses security risks
   - Evaluates performance risks
   - Checks deployment readiness

2. **code-quality-patterns**
   - Complexity metrics
   - Code duplication
   - SOLID principles
   - Naming conventions

**Note**: Specific analysis skills loaded by subagents (see Phase 3)

---

## Phase 3: Dispatch 3 Subagents in PARALLEL

**All 3 subagents run simultaneously (3x faster):**

### Subagent 1: analysis-risk-security
**Loads**: risk-analysis, security-patterns
**Tasks**:
- Identify security risks (OWASP Top 10)
- Verify authentication/authorization
- Validate input handling
- Check secret management
- Assess architectural risks
- Evaluate scalability risks

### Subagent 2: analysis-performance-quality
**Loads**: performance-patterns, code-quality-patterns
**Tasks**:
- Analyze database queries
- Check caching strategies
- Measure cyclomatic complexity
- Check for code duplication
- Verify SOLID principles
- Review naming conventions

### Subagent 3: analysis-ux-accessibility
**Loads**: ux-patterns, accessibility-patterns
**Tasks**:
- Check user experience
- Verify usability
- Verify WCAG compliance
- Check keyboard navigation
- Verify screen reader support
- Check color contrast

**Execution**: All 3 run in parallel
- Sequential: 15 minutes
- Parallel: 2-3 minutes
- **SPEEDUP: 3x FASTER!**

---

## Phase 4: Compile Results from All 3 Subagents

**Merge findings from parallel analysis:**

1. **Collect from Subagent 1** (risk-security)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Authentication issues
   - Input validation problems
   - Architectural risks

2. **Collect from Subagent 2** (performance-quality)
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Code quality issues
   - Complexity problems
   - Duplication

3. **Collect from Subagent 3** (ux-accessibility)
   - UX problems
   - Accessibility violations
   - Usability issues
   - Design inconsistencies

4. **Organize by severity:**
   - 🔴 Critical (fix immediately)
   - 🟡 Important (fix soon)
   - 🟢 Nice-to-have (consider)

---

## Phase 5: Generate Report

**Create comprehensive review report from merged findings:**

```markdown
# Code Review Report

## Summary
- Files reviewed: X
- Lines analyzed: X
- Issues found: X
- Quality score: X/10

## Critical Issues (🔴)
From Subagent 1 (Risk & Security):
- Security vulnerability: [Description]
- Architectural risk: [Description]

From Subagent 2 (Performance & Quality):
- Performance disaster: [Description]
- Critical complexity: [Description]

From Subagent 3 (UX & Accessibility):
- Critical accessibility violation: [Description]

## Important Issues (🟡)
- [From all 3 subagents]

## Nice to Have (🟢)
- [From all 3 subagents]

## Quality Metrics
- Security score: X/10
- Performance score: X/10
- Code quality score: X/10
- Accessibility score: X/10
- UX score: X/10
```

---

## Phase 6: Return Results

**Provide actionable feedback from all 3 subagents:**

1. **Critical issues** - Must fix before merge
2. **Important issues** - Should fix before merge
3. **Nice to have** - Consider for future
4. **Strengths** - What's working well
5. **Recommendations** - How to improve

**Offer next steps:**
```
Want me to:
• Plan fixes for critical issues?
• Build the fixes?
• Review the fixes?
```

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### If Subagent Fails

**Fallback Strategy**:
1. Retry failed subagent (up to 3 times with exponential backoff)
2. If still fails, use sequential analysis instead of parallel
3. If sequential fails, use cached results from previous runs
4. Return partial review with available results

**Example**:
```
Parallel Execution:
  ├─ Subagent 1 (risk-security): ✅ Success
  ├─ Subagent 2 (performance-quality): ❌ FAILED
  └─ Subagent 3 (ux-accessibility): ✅ Success

Fallback to Sequential:
  └─ Subagent 2 (retry): ✅ Success (on retry)

Result: Complete review with all dimensions
```

### If Skill Fails

**Fallback Strategy**:
1. Try to load skill from cache
2. If no cache, use minimal skill (metadata only)
3. Continue with available skills
4. Note missing analysis in results

**Example**:
```
Load Skill:
  ├─ Primary: ❌ FAILED
  ├─ Cache: ✅ Success
  └─ Use cached version

Result: Review continues with cached skill
```

### Timeout Handling

**If analysis takes too long**:
1. Wait up to 5 minutes per subagent
2. If timeout, use partial results
3. Return review with available findings
4. Note incomplete analysis
