# Phase 6: Testing Strategy

**Objective**: Ensure quality through comprehensive testing  
**Duration**: 1-2 minutes

## Testing Breakdown

```markdown
[Testing Strategy]

Unit Tests (70% coverage minimum):
- Service functions (business logic)
- Utility functions (validation, formatting)
- React component logic (not UI)

Files to test:
- auth.service.test.ts
  - test('registers new user successfully')
  - test('throws error for duplicate email')
  - test('hashes password correctly')

Integration Tests (API endpoints):
- End-to-end API flow tests
- Database interactions
- Authentication middleware

E2E Tests (User journeys):
- Critical user paths
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Register with valid email
- [ ] Register with duplicate email (expect error)
- [ ] Login with correct credentials
- [ ] Login with wrong password (expect error)
- [ ] Access protected route with valid token
- [ ] Access protected route without token (expect 401)
```

## Quality Gate

- ✅ Test coverage plan is comprehensive
- ✅ Both happy and error paths covered
- ✅ E2E scenarios identified
- ❌ If gaps → Add missing test scenarios
