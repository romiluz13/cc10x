# Phase 5: Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Objective**: Think through failure scenarios and edge cases  
**Duration**: 1-2 minutes

## Edge Cases Checklist

```markdown
[Edge Cases to Handle]

Authentication Edge Cases:
- [ ] User tries to register with existing email
- [ ] User enters invalid email format
- [ ] Password doesn't meet requirements
- [ ] Token expires while user is active
- [ ] User tries to access protected route without token
- [ ] Token is invalid or tampered with
- [ ] Multiple login attempts (rate limiting)

Data Validation Edge Cases:
- [ ] Empty required fields
- [ ] SQL injection attempts
- [ ] XSS attempts in user input
- [ ] Very long strings (buffer overflow)
- [ ] Special characters in names/emails
- [ ] Unicode characters handling

Network Edge Cases:
- [ ] API request timeout
- [ ] Network connection lost mid-request
- [ ] Server returns 500 error
- [ ] Rate limit exceeded (429)
- [ ] Duplicate form submissions

UI/UX Edge Cases:
- [ ] Loading states (spinner while fetching)
- [ ] Empty states (no users found)
- [ ] Error states (failed to load)
- [ ] Slow network (show skeleton loaders)
- [ ] Mobile viewport (responsive design)
- [ ] Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
```

## Error Handling Strategy

```markdown
[Error Handling]

Frontend:
- Show user-friendly error messages (not technical errors)
- Provide actionable next steps ("Try again" button)
- Log errors to monitoring service (Sentry)
- Graceful degradation (show cached data if API fails)

Backend:
- Return consistent error format
- Log errors with context (user ID, request ID)
- Don't expose internal errors to frontend
- Use HTTP status codes correctly (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
```

## Quality Gate

- ✅ All major edge cases identified
- ✅ Error handling strategy defined
- ✅ User experience considered for failures
- ❌ If incomplete → Add more edge cases
