# Feature Planning Guidance

## Purpose

Support structured feature planning with concrete templates, examples, and decision frameworks. Ensure requirements are testable, architecture is clear, risks are mitigated, and implementation is phased.

---

## Stage 1: Complexity Assessment

### Complexity Rubric (1-5)

Use this rubric to determine if comprehensive planning is warranted:

**1 - Trivial** (<50 LOC, single function, no dependencies)
- Examples: Add validation helper, format date string
- Recommendation: Implement directly, no planning needed

**2 - Simple** (50-200 LOC, single file, minimal risk)
- Examples: Add form field, update CSS styling
- Recommendation: Brief planning (5-10 min), implement

**3 - Moderate** (200-500 LOC, 2-5 files, adds/updates tests)
- Examples: Add API endpoint, create new component
- Recommendation: Planning workflow valuable, ~30 min

**4 - Complex** (500+ LOC, 5-10 files, novel patterns or integrations)
- Examples: Authentication flow, payment integration
- Recommendation: Comprehensive planning critical, ~1-2 hours

**5 - Architectural** (1000+ LOC, 10+ files, cross-cutting changes)
- Examples: Database migration, microservice split
- Recommendation: Multi-stage planning with approval gates

**Decision Point**: If complexity ≤2, confirm with user before proceeding with full planning.

## Stage 2: Requirements Gathering

### Requirements Template

```markdown
## Requirements

**Goal**: <One-sentence summary of what we're building and why>

**Stakeholders**:
- <Role>: <Name/Team> - <What they care about>

**User Stories**:
As a <role>, I want <capability> so that <business value>.

**Acceptance Criteria** (testable):
- [ ] <Specific, measurable criterion>
- [ ] <Specific, measurable criterion>

**Out of Scope** (what we're NOT doing):
- <Feature or capability explicitly excluded>

**Assumptions**:
- <Assumption that could affect design>

**Open Questions**:
- <Question requiring stakeholder input>
```

### Populated Example: User Authentication

```markdown
## Requirements

**Goal**: Allow users to create accounts and log in securely using email/password.

**Stakeholders**:
- Product: Sarah - Wants seamless onboarding, <2s login time
- Security: Mike - Requires bcrypt hashing, rate limiting
- Support: Lisa - Needs clear error messages for troubleshooting

**User Stories**:
- As a new user, I want to create an account with email/password so that I can access personalized features.
- As a returning user, I want to log in quickly so that I can resume my work.
- As a security-conscious user, I want my password to be securely hashed so that my account is protected.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] User can register with valid email (format validated)
- [ ] Password must be 12+ chars with upper, lower, number, symbol
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- [ ] Login rate limited to 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- [ ] JWT token issued on successful login
- [ ] Token expires after 7 days
- [ ] Clear error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials", not "Wrong password")

**Out of Scope**:
- Social login (Google, GitHub) - Phase 2
- Two-factor authentication - Phase 2
- Password reset via email - Phase 2

**Assumptions**:
- MongoDB for user storage
- JWT for session management (stateless)
- No existing authentication system to migrate from

**Open Questions**:
- Should we support "remember me" functionality? (extends token to 30 days)
- Password strength indicator on registration form?
```

## Stage 3: Architecture Design

### Architecture Template

```markdown
## Architecture

**System Context**:
<High-level: External actors → System → External services>

**Containers** (services, databases):
- <Container name>: <Technology> - <Purpose>

**Components** (within container):
- <Component>: <Responsibility> - <Key interfaces>

**Data Models**:
```typescript
// Entity definitions
```

**Key Decisions**:
- <Decision>: <Rationale> - <Trade-offs>

**Integration Points**:
- <External service>: <How we integrate> - <Error handling>
```

### Populated Example: User Authentication

```markdown
## Architecture

**System Context**:
User (Browser) → API (Node.js) → Database (MongoDB)

**Containers**:
- API: Node.js/Express - Handles authentication routes
- Database: MongoDB - Stores user credentials
- Cache: Redis (future) - Session invalidation (out of scope Phase 1)

**Components**:
- AuthController: Handles /register and /login endpoints
  - registerUser(email, password) → {userId, token}
  - loginUser(email, password) → {userId, token}
- AuthService: Business logic for authentication
  - hashPassword(plaintext) → hash
  - verifyPassword(plaintext, hash) → boolean
  - generateToken(userId) → JWT string
- UserRepository: Database operations
  - createUser(email, hashedPassword) → User
  - findUserByEmail(email) → User | null

**Data Models**:
```typescript
interface User {
  _id: ObjectId;
  email: string;           // Unique, indexed
  hashedPassword: string;  // Bcrypt hash
  createdAt: Date;
  lastLoginAt: Date | null;
}

interface JWT {
  userId: string;
  iat: number;  // Issued at
  exp: number;  // Expires (7 days)
}
```

**Key Decisions**:
- **JWT vs Sessions**: JWT (stateless, no Redis needed Phase 1)
  - Trade-off: Can't instantly revoke tokens, but simpler infrastructure
  - Mitigation: Short expiry (7 days), add Redis invalidation in Phase 2
- **Bcrypt vs Argon2**: Bcrypt (industry standard, proven)
  - Trade-off: Argon2 slightly more secure, but less ecosystem support
- **MongoDB vs PostgreSQL**: MongoDB (team familiarity, flexible schema)
  - Risk: NoSQL injection if not careful (mitigation: type validation)

**Integration Points**:
- Email service (future): Password reset emails - Phase 2
- Rate limiter: Express-rate-limit middleware
  - Error handling: Return 429 Too Many Requests
```

## Stage 4: Risk Analysis

### Risk Register Template

```markdown
## Risks

| Stage | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|-------|------------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| <Framework stage> | <What could go wrong> | H/M/L | H/M/L | <How we'll prevent/handle> | <Team/person> |
```

### Populated Example: User Authentication

```markdown
## Risks

| Stage | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|-------|------------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Security | NoSQL injection via email field | Medium | High | Validate input type (must be string), use parameterized queries | Backend |
| Security | Brute force password guessing | High | High | Rate limit 5 attempts/15min, lock account after 10 failed attempts | Backend |
| Security | JWT secret leaked | Low | Critical | Store in env var, rotate every 90 days, never commit to git | DevOps |
| UX | Vague error messages help attackers | Medium | Medium | Generic "Invalid credentials" message (don't reveal if email exists) | Backend |
| Performance | Bcrypt hashing blocks event loop | Medium | Medium | Use bcrypt.hash (async), not bcrypt.hashSync | Backend |
| Data Flow | Password sent over HTTP (not HTTPS) | Low | Critical | Enforce HTTPS in production, redirect HTTP → HTTPS | DevOps |
| Failure Modes | MongoDB connection failure during login | Low | High | Retry logic (3 attempts), graceful error "Service unavailable, try again" | Backend |
```

### Risk Scoring Guide

**Probability**:
- High: Likely to occur (>50% chance)
- Medium: Could occur (10-50%)
- Low: Unlikely (<10%)

**Impact**:
- High: System unusable, data loss, security breach
- Medium: Degraded performance, user frustration
- Low: Minor inconvenience, easy workaround

**Priority** = Probability × Impact
- High × High = P0 (must address before launch)
- High × Medium or Medium × High = P1 (address before launch if possible)
- All others = P2 (monitor and address post-launch)

```

### Populated Example: User Authentication

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Core Authentication** (Complexity: 4)
- **Files to Create**:
  - `src/auth/auth.controller.ts` - Express routes
  - `src/auth/auth.service.ts` - Business logic
  - `src/auth/auth.middleware.ts` - JWT verification
  - `src/models/user.model.ts` - MongoDB schema
  - `src/repositories/user.repository.ts` - DB operations
  - `tests/auth.spec.ts` - Unit tests
  - `tests/integration/auth.integration.spec.ts` - Integration tests
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `src/app.ts` - Register auth routes
  - `src/config/database.ts` - Add User collection
  - `.env.example` - Add JWT_SECRET, BCRYPT_ROUNDS
- **Tests to Add**:
  - Unit: hashPassword, verifyPassword, generateToken
  - Integration: POST /register, POST /login (success and failure cases)
  - E2E: Full registration → login flow
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - All tests passing (100% coverage for auth module)
  - Manual test: Register + login works in staging
  - Rate limiting verified (5 attempts then blocked)
- **Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours

**Phase 2: Rate Limiting & Error Handling**
- **Files to Create**:
  - `src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`
  - `src/utils/error-responses.ts`
- **Files to Modify**:
  - `src/auth/auth.controller.ts` - Add rate limiter middleware
- **Exit Criteria**:
  - Rate limiter blocks after 5 attempts
  - Error messages are user-friendly and secure
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Phase 3: Deployment**
- Feature flag: `AUTH_ENABLED=true`
- Rollout: LOW-RISK (new feature, no existing users)
  - Deploy with flag OFF
  - Wait 1 hour (verify app stable)
  - Enable flag for 10% users (internal team)
  - Wait 24 hours
  - Enable for 100%
- **Rollback**: Set `AUTH_ENABLED=false`, restart app (<5 min)

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit tests** (20 tests):
  - Password hashing/verification
  - JWT token generation/validation
  - Input validation (email format, password strength)
- **Integration tests** (15 tests):
  - POST /register success (valid input)
  - POST /register failures (duplicate email, weak password)
  - POST /login success
  - POST /login failures (wrong password, nonexistent user)
  - Rate limiting (6th attempt blocked)
- **E2E tests** (3 scenarios):
  - Happy path: Register → Login → Access protected route
  - Error path: Invalid credentials → Retry → Success
  - Rate limit: 5 failed attempts → 429 error

**Deployment Strategy**:
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (authentication is security-critical)
- **Pre-Deployment Checklist**:
  - [ ] JWT_SECRET configured in production env
  - [ ] HTTPS enforced
  - [ ] MongoDB indexes created (email unique)
  - [ ] Rate limiter tested (5 attempts limit)
  - [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
  - [ ] Monitoring dashboard configured (login success rate, error rate)
```

## Decision Frameworks

### When to Skip Comprehensive Planning

**Skip if** (Complexity 1-2):
- Single file change <200 LOC
- No external dependencies
- Clear, well-documented pattern exists
- Low risk (no security, auth, or data integrity concerns)

**Example**: Adding a formatDate helper function → Just implement it

### When Planning is Critical

**Always plan if** (Complexity 4-5):
- Security-critical (auth, payments, data access)
- Novel architecture pattern
- Breaking changes
- Multiple integrations
- High user impact

**Example**: Authentication system → Comprehensive planning mandatory

## Verification Reminder

Always end planning with a verification summary:

```markdown
## Planning Verification

**Inputs Reviewed**:
- [ ] User requirements gathered from stakeholders
- [ ] Existing auth patterns in codebase analyzed
- [ ] Security best practices consulted

**Outstanding Questions**:
- "Remember me" functionality decision pending (ask product team)

**Follow-Up Tasks**:
- Review with security team before implementation
- Set up monitoring dashboard for auth metrics
- Schedule deployment for Tuesday 2pm (avoid Friday)

**Next Step**: Proceed to BUILD workflow with this plan
```
