# Planning Patterns Library

This document provides a comprehensive library of planning patterns covering requirements analysis and feature planning.

## Requirements Analysis Patterns

### Requirements Gathering Patterns

- Stakeholder interviews
- User story mapping
- Use case analysis
- Requirement documentation

### Requirements Mapping Patterns

- Map requirements to user flows
- Map requirements to system flows
- Map requirements to integration flows
- Document requirement mappings

### Gap Identification Patterns

- Identify missing requirements
- Identify conflicting requirements
- Identify ambiguous requirements
- Document gaps

### Acceptance Criteria Patterns

- Given-When-Then format
- Testable criteria
- Functionality-aligned criteria
- Measurable outcomes

## Feature Planning Patterns

### Architecture Design Patterns

- Component breakdown
- System boundaries
- Integration points
- Technology selection

### Component Design Patterns

- Component responsibilities
- Component interfaces
- Component dependencies
- Component composition

### Implementation Roadmap Patterns

- Phased implementation
- Dependency ordering
- Risk mitigation
- Timeline estimation

### Complexity Assessment Patterns

- 1-5 complexity scale
- LOC estimation
- File count estimation
- Risk assessment

## Pattern Usage

Reference these patterns when planning:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Use gathering, mapping, gap identification, acceptance criteria patterns
2. **Feature Planning**: Use architecture design, component design, roadmap, complexity assessment patterns

## Pattern Composition

These patterns can be composed together:

- Requirements Analysis + Feature Planning = Complete planning
- Architecture Design + Component Design = Comprehensive design
- Requirements Mapping + Acceptance Criteria = Testable planning

See `plugins/cc10x/skills/shared-patterns/PATTERN-COMPOSITION.md` for composition guidelines.
