### BUILD preparation

1. Read `- Plan:` from `activeContext.md ## References`.
2. If plan path is not `N/A`, `Read(...)` the plan file before creating tasks.
3. Run `plan_trust_gate` before BUILD:
   - `Open Decisions` must be empty or explicitly marked approved.
   - `Differences from agreement` must be present, even if empty.
   - `plan_mode` must be explicit when a plan artifact exists.
   - `verification_rigor` must be explicit when a plan artifact exists.
   - If `plan_mode` is `execution_plan` or `decision_rfc`: every phase in `normalized_phases` must carry non-empty `exit_criteria`, and `intent.acceptance_criteria` must be non-empty. Field presence is not enough — field completeness is required.
   - Cross-check `intent.constraints` against approved decisions. If any approved decision explicitly contradicts an `intent.constraint`, emit NOGO with the contradiction and ask the user to resolve before BUILD starts.
   - If any condition fails, ask for clarification and do not start BUILD.
4. If plan path is `N/A`, assess scope before dispatch and record `build_scope`:
   - **Trivial** (single concern, one file group, one failure mode) → set `build_scope=trivial` and continue directly to BUILD.
     Heuristic signals: touches 1-2 files, single logical change, one testable outcome, no cross-module wiring.
     [EASY TO MISS: When the task is clearly trivial, do not ask clarifying questions or suggest planning. Execute directly. Analysis paralysis on trivial work is a net negative.]
   - **Non-trivial** (spans multiple independent file groups, has separable concerns, or involves distinct failure modes) → set `build_scope=standard` and ask: `Plan first (Recommended)` or `Build directly`.
     Heuristic signals: touches 3+ files across different directories, multiple independent concerns that could fail separately, changes to both interface and implementation, or new cross-module dependencies.
   - `Plan first` -> switch to PLAN workflow.
   - `Build directly` -> continue without a plan.
   - When a plan artifact exists (plan path is not `N/A`), `build_scope=standard` always. Planned work never takes the trivial graph.
5. If the referenced plan file is missing:
   - Ask: `Build without plan` or `Re-plan first (Recommended)`.
   - `Build without plan` -> continue with `plan:N/A`
   - `Re-plan first` -> switch to PLAN workflow
6. Normalize planner phases into executable `normalized_phases` and initialize `phase_cursor` to the first incomplete phase.
7. Persist the approved `plan_mode` and `verification_rigor` from the planner contract into the workflow artifact.
8. Every normalized phase must carry:
   - `objective`
   - `inputs`
   - `files/surfaces`
   - `expected_artifacts`
   - `required_checks`
   - `checkpoint_type`
   - `exit_criteria`
9. Initialize workflow `proof_status` to `gaps_found` until the current phase is independently verified.
10. Clarify missing requirements before builder only when the plan and memory do not already answer them.
11. Persist pre-answered clarifications in `activeContext.md ## Decisions` using `Build clarification [{topic}]: {answer}`.
12. Builder may execute only the phase at `phase_cursor`.
13. Router handoff for the current BUILD phase must be phase-local:
   - include only the current phase objective, inputs, expected artifacts, required checks, checkpoint type, exit criteria, and approved clarifications still in force
   - include prior-phase detail only when it remains an active blocker, dependency, or unresolved finding
   - do not rehydrate broad historical narrative when the workflow artifact already captures it

### BUILD task graph

BUILD is sequential:
- one approved executable phase at a time
- one builder run for the current phase only
- review, hunt, and verify validate that phase before `phase_cursor` advances
- if phase exit evidence is incomplete, record `partial` or `blocked`, persist state, and stop

**Complexity gradient (read `build_scope` from BUILD preparation step 4):**
The router is still the sole entry point for every BUILD, but the task graph scales to the work. This is a deliberate gradient, not the retired unconditional QUICK path: trivial work earns a reduced graph; everything else pays the full chain.

- `build_scope=trivial` → use the **reduced task graph** below: `component-builder` → `integration-verifier` → `Memory Update`. NO separate `code-reviewer` task, NO `silent-failure-hunter` task, NO standalone `doc-syncer` task. The verifier still runs its real proof path (never weaken `verifier-latency-model.md` must_keep_core) and folds a brief review/edge-case pass into its report.
- `build_scope=standard` (default, and always when a plan exists) → use the **full task graph** further below.

**Escalation rule (trivial → full):** after the builder returns, if its Router Contract reports non-empty `SCOPE_INCREASES` or non-empty `BLOCKED_ITEMS`, the work was not actually trivial. Before advancing, promote the workflow to the full graph: create the `code-reviewer` and `silent-failure-hunter` tasks (blocked by the builder) and the `doc-syncer` task (blocked by the verifier), and re-block Memory Update on `doc_sync_task_id`. Persist `build_scope=standard` and an escalation entry in `status_history`.

```

If the builder triggers the escalation rule, convert this into the full graph before running the verifier: add reviewer + hunter (blocked by builder), add doc-syncer (blocked by verifier), re-block verifier on `[reviewer_task_id, hunter_task_id]`, and re-block Memory Update on `doc_sync_task_id`.

**Opt-out check:** Before creating the doc-sync task, read `activeContext.md ## Session Settings`.

```

### doc-syncer SKIPPED state

If doc-syncer returns `STATUS: SKIPPED` (i.e., `IMPACT_LEVEL: none`), the router treats it as a passing state — equivalent to `COMPLETE` for workflow-advance purposes. The router must not block Memory Update when the SKIPPED contract is present and `SKIP_REASON` is non-empty. Advance to Memory Update immediately.
