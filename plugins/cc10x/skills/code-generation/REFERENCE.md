# Code Generation - Reference

Reference checklist and patterns for code generation. Use AFTER understanding functionality (see SKILL.md Steps 1-2).

## Code Generation Checklist (Reference - Use AFTER Functionality Understood)

**⚠️ Only check these AFTER functionality is understood**:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness; keep functions focused and small (supports functionality understanding)
- Preserve separation of concerns (supports functionality maintenance)
- Handle errors explicitly and surface actionable messages (supports functionality reliability)
- Cover edge cases and input validation before returning success (supports functionality reliability)
- Keep public APIs stable; document breaking changes for review (supports functionality evolution)
- Align with project patterns (follows existing structure and conventions)
