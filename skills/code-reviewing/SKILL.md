# Code Reviewing - Multi-Dimensional Analysis Workflow

## Overview

Comprehensive code review with parallel multi-dimensional analysis. Five specialized reviewers examine code simultaneously for complete coverage.

**Core principle:** Parallel read-only analysis across all quality dimensions, synthesize findings, prioritize actions.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the code-reviewing skill to analyze this code."

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Parallel Multi-Dimensional Analysis (5 reviewers)
    ‚Üì
Phase 2: Synthesis & Prioritization (orchestrator)
    ‚Üì
Phase 3: Optional Auto-Fix (conditional, 1 agent)
```

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Estimated Tokens**: ~40k (parallel execution)

## Parallel Execution Rules ‚ö°

| Phase | Max Parallel Agents | Reasoning |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Phase 1 (Analysis) | **5 agents** ‚úÖ | All read-only, completely independent |
| Phase 2 (Synthesis) | **0 agents** | Orchestrator handles (no sub-agents) |
| Phase 3 (Auto-Fix) | **1 agent** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Conditional, only if safe fixes available |

## Phase 1: Parallel Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze code across all quality dimensions simultaneously

**Duration**: ~3-5 minutes

**Sub-Agents**: Launch 5 specialized reviewers in parallel (all read-only, safe)

**Parallel Execution Benefits**:
```
Sequential: 5 reviews √ó 3 min = 15 minutes
Parallel:   max(5 reviews) = 3-5 minutes
Time saved: 67% faster ‚ö°
```

**Quality Gate**:
- ‚úÖ All 5 reviewers completed
- ‚úÖ Findings documented with severity
- ‚úÖ Recommendations actionable
- ‚ùå If any reviewer fails ‚Üí Report error, continue with others

## Phase 2: Synthesis & Prioritization

**Objective**: Consolidate findings and prioritize actions

**Duration**: ~2 minutes

**Responsibility**: Orchestrator (you)

**Synthesis Process**:

```markdown
[Consolidate Findings]

Review all 5 outputs:
- security-findings.md
- quality-findings.md
- performance-findings.md
- ux-findings.md
- accessibility-findings.md

Categorize by severity:
1. üî¥ Critical (must fix immediately)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Accessibility blockers
   - Performance killers

2. üü† High Priority (fix before merge)
   - Security best practices
   - Major code smells
   - UX confusions

3. üü° Medium Priority (address soon)
   - Refactoring opportunities
   - Performance optimizations
   - UX improvements

4. üü¢ Low Priority (nice to have)
   - Code style improvements
   - Minor optimizations
   - Documentation enhancements

Identify safe auto-fixes:
- Formatting issues
- Import sorting
- Unused variable removal
- Simple refactorings (const vs let, etc.)
```

**Prioritization Matrix**:

| Severity | Impact | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | Security breach, data loss | SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass |
| High | Poor UX, maintenance burden | Complex code, N+1 queries, a11y issues |
| Medium | Technical debt, optimization | Duplication, inefficient algorithms |
| Low | Polish, consistency | Naming, comments, formatting |

**Output Format**:

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

**Files Reviewed**: [list]
**Total Issues**: [count by severity]

### üî¥ Critical Issues (must fix immediately)
1. [Security] SQL injection in user.service.ts:45
   - Impact: Data breach potential
   - Recommendation: Use parameterized queries
   - Example: [code snippet]

### üü† High Priority (fix before merge)
...

### üü° Medium Priority (address soon)
...

### üü¢ Low Priority (nice to have)
...

### Safe Auto-Fixes Available
- [ ] Format code with Prettier
- [ ] Sort imports
- [ ] Remove 5 unused variables
- [ ] Convert 3 var ‚Üí const
```

**Quality Gate**:
- ‚úÖ All findings categorized by severity
- ‚úÖ Recommendations are actionable
- ‚úÖ Safe auto-fixes identified
- ‚úÖ Summary is clear and concise
- ‚ùå If no actionable recommendations ‚Üí Report "code looks good"

## Phase 3: Optional Auto-Fix

**Objective**: Automatically fix safe issues (conditional)

**Duration**: ~2-3 minutes (if executed)

**Condition**: Only runs if safe auto-fixes available

**Sub-Agent**: Launch auto-fixer (ONE agent, sequential)

```markdown
Task for auto-fixer:

Apply safe fixes identified in Phase 2:
- Formatting (Prettier/ESLint)
- Import sorting
- Unused variable removal
- Simple const/let conversions
- Missing semicolons/commas

Auto-invoked skill: safe-refactoring

Requirements:
1. Apply ONLY safe fixes (no behavior changes)
2. Run tests after EACH change (checkpoint-driven)
3. Rollback on test failure
4. Report what was fixed

DO NOT:
- Change logic or behavior
- Refactor complex code
- Modify critical files (auth, payment, etc.)
- Make breaking changes
```

**Safe Refactoring Guidelines**:

```markdown
‚úÖ Safe Auto-Fixes:
- Formatting (whitespace, indentation)
- Import organization (alphabetical, grouped)
- Unused imports/variables removal
- const vs let (when immutable)
- Add missing semicolons
- Fix typos in comments
- Add missing return types (TypeScript)

‚ùå NOT Safe Auto-Fixes:
- Logic changes
- Renaming public APIs
- Database schema changes
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Complex refactorings
- Dependency updates
```

**Checkpoint-Driven Execution**:

```
For each safe fix:
1. Apply change
2. Run tests
3. If tests pass ‚Üí Commit change
4. If tests fail ‚Üí Rollback change, report
5. Continue with next fix
```

**Quality Gate**:
- ‚úÖ All safe fixes applied successfully
- ‚úÖ Tests pass after all changes
- ‚úÖ Git status clean (no uncommitted changes)
- ‚ùå If tests fail ‚Üí Rollback, report failed fixes

## Finalization

## Error Handling

### If No Files Specified

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è No files specified for review

Action: Ask user
- "Which files should I review?"
- "Do you want to review a PR? (provide URL)"
- "Should I review the entire codebase? (may take longer)"
```

### If PR URL Provided

```markdown
[Fetch PR Information]

1. Use gh CLI to fetch PR details:
   - Files changed
   - Commit messages
   - PR description

2. Review only changed files (efficient)

3. Include PR context in review:
   - Does implementation match PR description?
   - Are commit messages clear?
   - Are there test updates?
```

### If Reviewer Fails

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è [Reviewer] failed to complete

Action: Continue with other reviewers
- Note failure in report
- Provide partial review
- User can re-run failed reviewer separately
```

### If No Issues Found

```markdown
‚úÖ Code looks good!

All reviewers report no critical or high-priority issues.

Minor suggestions:
- [list any low-priority improvements]

No auto-fixes needed.
```
