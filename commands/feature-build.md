# Feature Build Command

Implement complete features using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) with automatic quality gates and multi-dimensional verification. This command orchestrates the full development lifecycle from context analysis through implementation to final verification and clean commits.

Perfect for building production-ready features that follow project patterns and maintain high quality standards.

## What This Does

This command orchestrates a 5-phase development workflow:

- **Phase 1: Context Analysis** - Automatically finds similar patterns in your codebase to follow
- **Phase 2: Planning** - Breaks feature into small, testable increments
- **Phase 3: Implementation** - TDD-enforced sequential development (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
- **Phase 4: Verification** - Multi-dimensional quality checks (security, performance, quality, UX, accessibility)
- **Phase 5: Finalization** - Clean commit with semantic message

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Strict TDD Enforcement** - No production code without failing test first
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Following** - Automatically adopts your project's conventions
- ‚úÖ **Quality Gates** - Must pass before proceeding to next phase
- ‚úÖ **Progressive Loading** - 93% token savings via staged context loading
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Healing** - Snapshots at 75% token usage prevent context loss
- ‚úÖ **File Conflict Prevention** - Sequential implementation (never parallel)
- ‚úÖ **Lovable/Bolt Quality UI** - Production-ready components, not prototypes

## When to Use

Use `/feature-build` when you need to:

- **Implement a planned feature** - You have a plan (from `/feature-plan` or in your head)
- **Build with TDD** - You want test-first development enforced
- **Follow project patterns** - You want automatic pattern discovery and adherence
- **Ensure quality** - You want multi-dimensional verification before commit
- **Ship production code** - You need polished, complete, deployment-ready code

**Don't use when:**
- Just planning (use `/feature-plan` first)
- Fixing bugs (use `/bug-fix` instead - includes LOG FIRST pattern)
- Reviewing code (use `/review` instead)
- Making trivial changes (< 20 lines, just edit directly)

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Analysis (Automatic)

**Goal:** Understand existing codebase patterns to follow

**Sub-Agent:** context-analyzer

**Process:**
1. **Find Similar Features**
   - Search for features similar to what you're building
   - Identify existing implementations to learn from
   - Extract patterns and conventions

2. **Identify Project Conventions**
   - Naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case, etc.)
   - File structure patterns (where things go)
   - Error handling approaches
   - Validation patterns
   - Testing patterns

3. **Map Integration Points**
   - Database connections and models
   - API endpoints and routing
   - External services and dependencies
   - State management patterns

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What this feature depends on
   - What might depend on this feature
   - Potential breaking changes

**Quality Gate:** Clear understanding of patterns to follow

**Output Example:**
```markdown
## Context Analysis Results

### Similar Features Found
- Authentication: src/features/auth/ (JWT-based, follows middleware pattern)
- User Management: src/features/users/ (CRUD with validation)

### Project Conventions
- **File Structure:** Feature-based (src/features/{name}/)
- **Naming:** camelCase for files, PascalCase for components
- **Error Handling:** Custom AppError class, centralized error middleware
- **Validation:** Joi schemas in validators/ subfolder
- **Testing:** Jest, tests in __tests__/ alongside code

### Integration Points
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose (src/config/database.ts)
- **API Routes:** Express router in routes/ subfolder
- **Middleware:** Auth middleware at src/middleware/auth.ts

### Dependencies
- Depends on: User model, Auth middleware
- Impacts: None (new feature)
```

---

### Phase 2: Planning (Automatic)

**Goal:** Break feature into small, testable increments

**Process:**
1. **Decompose Feature**
   - Break into smallest independently valuable pieces
   - Each increment should be < 200 lines of code
   - Order by dependencies (what needs what)

2. **Define Test-First Approach**
   - Specify what test to write first for each increment
   - Identify test data needed
   - Plan assertions

3. **Identify Parallel vs Sequential**
   - What can be built in parallel (independent components)
   - What must be sequential (dependencies)
   - **CRITICAL:** Only ONE implementer at a time (prevent conflicts)

4. **Set Quality Gates**
   - Define "done" criteria for each increment
   - Specify coverage targets (>80%)
   - Plan verification steps

**Quality Gate:** Clear, actionable implementation plan

**Output Example:**
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Increment 1: Payment Model (Sequential, 1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Create database model for payments

**Test First:**
```javascript
describe('Payment Model', () => {
  it('should create payment with required fields', async () => {
    const payment = await Payment.create({
      userId: 'user123',
      amount: 29.99,
      currency: 'USD',
      status: 'pending'
    });
    expect(payment).toBeDefined();
    expect(payment.status).toBe('pending');
  });
});
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create src/features/payments/models/payment.ts
2. Define Mongoose schema
3. Add validation rules
4. Write 5+ unit tests

**Quality Gate:**
- All tests pass
- Coverage > 90%
- No linting errors

---

### Increment 2: Payment Service (Sequential, 2-3 hours)
**Goal:** Business logic for processing payments

[Continue for all increments...]
```

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (TDD-Enforced)

**Goal:** Build the feature with strict test-first development

**Sub-Agent:** implementer

**Process for EACH Increment:**

#### Step 1: RED (Write Failing Test)
```
1. Write test that defines desired behavior
2. Include edge cases
3. Make test specific and clear
4. Run test ‚Üí MUST FAIL
5. Verify failure reason is correct
```

**CRITICAL RULE:** If test passes without implementation, test is wrong. Fix test first.

#### Step 2: GREEN (Make It Pass)
```
1. Write MINIMUM code to pass test
2. Don't add extra features
3. Don't optimize yet
4. Focus solely on making test green
5. Run test ‚Üí MUST PASS
6. Run ALL tests ‚Üí MUST ALL PASS
```

**CRITICAL RULE:** If existing tests break, fix immediately before proceeding.

#### Step 3: REFACTOR (Improve Quality)
```
1. Improve code structure (optional)
2. Extract reusable functions
3. Optimize performance if needed
4. Clean up duplication
5. Run ALL tests ‚Üí MUST STILL PASS
```

**CRITICAL RULE:** Refactoring must not change behavior. Tests prove this.

#### Step 4: Verify Increment
```
1. Check coverage (>80% required)
2. Run linter (no errors allowed)
3. Verify patterns followed
4. Check no debug code (console.log, debugger, TODO)
5. Confirm quality gate met
```

#### Step 5: Move to Next Increment
```
Only after current increment is COMPLETE:
- Tests pass
- Coverage met
- Linting clean
- Quality gate passed
```

**Quality Gate:** All increments implemented with TDD, all tests passing, no linting errors

**Real-Time Example:**
```
üî¥ RED: Writing test for Payment.create()...
‚úÖ Test written: should create payment with required fields
‚ùå Test run: FAILED (Payment model doesn't exist) ‚Üê EXPECTED

üü¢ GREEN: Writing Payment model...
‚úÖ Model created: src/features/payments/models/payment.ts
‚úÖ Test run: PASSED
‚úÖ All tests run: PASSED (45/45)

üîµ REFACTOR: Extracting validation to helper...
‚úÖ Refactored: validatePaymentAmount() helper
‚úÖ All tests run: PASSED (45/45)

‚úÖ INCREMENT 1 COMPLETE
Coverage: 92% | Tests: 45/45 passing | Linting: ‚úì Clean

Moving to Increment 2...
```

---

### Phase 4: Verification (Multi-Dimensional)

**Goal:** Comprehensive quality check before commit

**Sub-Agents:** security-reviewer, quality-reviewer, performance-analyzer, ux-reviewer, accessibility-reviewer

**Process (Parallel Reviews):**

1. **Security Review**
   - Scan for vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Check authentication/authorization
   - Verify input validation
   - Check for secrets in code
   - **BLOCKS commit if critical issues found**

2. **Quality Review**
   - Check code smells
   - Identify duplication
   - Assess maintainability
   - Verify patterns followed
   - **BLOCKS commit if major issues found**

3. **Performance Review**
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Check for N+1 queries
   - Verify efficient algorithms
   - Check bundle size impact
   - **WARNS but doesn't block (can defer optimization)**

4. **UX Review**
   - Check error messages are clear
   - Verify loading states present
   - Assess user feedback
   - Check interaction patterns
   - **WARNS but doesn't block (can improve iteratively)**

5. **Accessibility Review**
   - Check WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Verify keyboard navigation
   - Check screen reader support
   - Verify color contrast
   - **BLOCKS commit if critical a11y issues found**

**Quality Gate:** No critical issues, warnings acknowledged

**Output Example:**
```markdown
## Verification Results

### Security Review ‚úÖ PASS
- ‚úÖ Input validation present
- ‚úÖ No secrets in code
- ‚úÖ Authentication checked
- ‚úÖ No SQL injection vectors
**Status:** Ready for commit

**Status:** Can improve iteratively, not blocking

### Accessibility Review ‚úÖ PASS
- ‚úÖ ARIA labels present
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation works
- ‚úÖ Color contrast sufficient
**Status:** Ready for commit

---

**OVERALL:** ‚úÖ Ready for commit (2 warnings to address in future)
```

---

### Phase 5: Finalization (Automatic)

**Goal:** Clean commit with semantic message

**Process:**
1. **Stage Changes**
   - Stage all modified files
   - Verify no unintended changes included
   - Check no sensitive data in commit

2. **Generate Semantic Commit Message**
   ```
   Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   
   Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, style, perf, chore
   Scope: feature name or component
   Subject: Present tense, lowercase, < 72 chars
   ```

3. **Commit**
   - Commit with generated message
   - Push to branch (if configured)

4. **Summary Report**
   - Files created/modified/deleted
   - Lines added/removed
   - Test coverage change
   - Build status

**Quality Gate:** Clean commit with descriptive message

**Output Example:**
```markdown

## Best Practices

### 1. **Plan First (When Possible)**
For complex features, run `/feature-plan` first. For simple features, `/feature-build` can plan automatically.

### 2. **Trust the TDD Process**
Write tests first. Always. Even when it feels slower. It's faster in the long run.

### 3. **Keep Increments Small**
Smaller increments = easier testing, faster feedback, less risk. Aim for < 200 lines per increment.

### 4. **Don't Skip Verification**
The multi-dimensional review catches issues before they become tech debt. Let it run.

### 5. **Address Warnings Strategically**
- **CRITICAL:** Fix before commit
- **WARNINGS:** Can defer but create tickets
- **INFO:** Nice to have, not required

### 6. **Review the Context Analysis**
If the command is following wrong patterns, the context analysis found wrong examples. Guide it explicitly.

### 7. **Commit Often**
The command commits at the end, but for large features you might want to commit per increment. That's fine.

### 8. **Read the Verification Report**
Don't just check if it passed. Read WHY. Learn from the feedback.

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: Tests are passing without implementation

**Symptom:** Test goes green immediately without writing code

**Cause:** Test isn't actually testing anything

**Solution:**
1. Check test has assertions
2. Verify test is actually running (not skipped)
3. Make test more specific
4. The implementer agent will catch this and fix the test

---

### Issue: Existing tests breaking

**Symptom:** New code breaks old tests

**Cause:** Changed behavior unintentionally

**Solution:**
1. Review what changed
2. Decide: Is new behavior correct?
   - **Yes:** Update old tests to reflect new behavior
   - **No:** Fix new code to maintain old behavior
3. The implementer agent stops and fixes immediately

---

### Issue: Context analysis found wrong patterns

**Symptom:** Command is following patterns you don't want

**Cause:** Context analysis found examples that aren't the pattern you want

**Solution:**
1. Be more explicit: `/feature-build Add auth using JWT (NOT session-based)`
2. Specify files to follow: `/feature-build Add payments following src/features/subscriptions/ pattern`
3. Override with explicit guidance

---

### Issue: Feature too large / running too long

**Symptom:** Implementation taking many hours, context filling up

**Cause:** Feature scope too large

**Solution:**
1. **Stop and split:** Break into smaller features
2. **Continue from plan:** If you have a plan, implement one increment at a time:
   - `/feature-build Implement increment 1 from plan: User model`
   - `/feature-build Implement increment 2 from plan: Auth controller`
3. **Auto-healing will save you:** At 75% token usage, automatic snapshot created

---

### Issue: Verification failing

**Symptom:** Critical issues found in verification phase

**Cause:** Code has security/quality/accessibility problems

**Solution:**
1. **Read the report carefully** - Understand what's wrong
2. **Fix the issues** - The command will guide you
3. **Re-run verification** - Must pass before commit
4. **Don't bypass** - Critical issues block commit for good reason

---

### Issue: Commit message not descriptive enough

**Symptom:** Generated commit message is too generic

**Cause:** Feature description was vague

**Solution:**
1. **Edit the commit message** - You can always amend: `git commit --amend`
2. **Be more specific next time:** 
   - Bad: `/feature-build Add payments`
   - Good: `/feature-build Add Stripe payment processing with webhook handling`

---

## Related Commands

### `/feature-plan`
**Use before** `/feature-build` for complex features.

**Workflow:**
```bash
/feature-plan Add real-time notifications
# Review plan...
/feature-build Implement notifications based on plan
```

---

### `/bug-fix`
**Use instead of** `/feature-build` when fixing issues.

**When to use which:**
- New functionality ‚Üí `/feature-build`
- Broken functionality ‚Üí `/bug-fix` (includes LOG FIRST pattern)

---

### `/review`
**Use after** `/feature-build` for additional verification before PR.

**Workflow:**
```bash
/feature-build Add user dashboard
/review src/features/dashboard/  # Pre-PR check
# Create PR
```

- ‚úÖ Code makes test pass (GREEN)
- ‚úÖ All tests pass (including existing)
- ‚úÖ Coverage > 80%
- ‚úÖ No linting errors
- ‚úÖ No debug code

### Phase 4: Verification
- ‚úÖ No critical security issues
- ‚úÖ No major quality issues
- ‚úÖ No critical accessibility issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance warnings acknowledged
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UX warnings acknowledged

## Token Usage

This command uses progressive loading and auto-healing:

### Progressive Loading (93% savings)
- **Stage 1:** Metadata only (~50 tokens)
- **Stage 2:** Context analysis (~500 tokens)
- **Stage 3:** Implementation details (~1,000-2,000 tokens per increment)

### Auto-Healing (Context Preservation)
- **At 75% token usage:** Automatic snapshot created
- **At 100%:** New context window with summary
- **Seamless continuation:** No loss of progress

**Typical usage:** 3,000-8,000 tokens for small features, 15,000-30,000 for large features

**Without progressive loading:** 50,000-100,000 tokens for same features

---

## Success Metrics

A successful feature build has:

- ‚úÖ **Tests written first** - TDD cycle followed for all code
- ‚úÖ **All tests passing** - New and existing
- ‚úÖ **High coverage** - >80% (typically 85-95%)
- ‚úÖ **No linting errors** - Clean code
- ‚úÖ **No debug code** - No console.log, debugger, TODO
- ‚úÖ **Patterns followed** - Matches project conventions
- ‚úÖ **Verification passed** - No critical issues
- ‚úÖ **Clean commit** - Semantic message, no extra files
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Can deploy immediately

**If missing any of these, feature is not complete.**

---

## Configuration

### TDD Enforcement
- **Strictness:** MAXIMUM (no exceptions)
- **Cycle:** RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR (mandatory)
- **Test-first:** 100% (no code without test)

### File Conflict Prevention
- **Parallelization:** DISABLED for implementation
- **Sequential:** ONE increment at a time
- **Safe parallelization:** Only for analysis/review

### UI Quality Standard
- **Target:** Lovable/Bolt quality (production-ready)
- **Not acceptable:** Prototype, placeholder, "TODO: style this"
- **Requirements:** Responsive, accessible, polished

---

## Notes

- Implementation time varies: 2-20 hours depending on complexity
- TDD feels slower initially but prevents 5-10 hours of debugging
- Verification warnings are learning opportunities, not just boxes to check
- Auto-healing ensures you never lose progress on large features
- The command won't let you commit broken or low-quality code
- Trust the process, especially the TDD enforcement
