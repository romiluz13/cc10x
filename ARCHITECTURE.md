## How Orchestration Works

### Example: `/feature-build` Command Flow

```
User Types: /feature-build Add user authentication

Step 1: Command Entry Point (feature-build.md)
         ↓ invokes
Step 2: Sub-Agent (implementer.md)
         ↓ auto-loads
Step 3: Skills
         • feature-building (orchestration logic)
         • test-driven-development (TDD enforcement)
         • code-generation (write code)
         • systematic-debugging (if issues arise)
         ↓ produces
Step 4: Production Code + Tests
```

### Example: `/review` Command Flow

```
User Types: /review src/features/auth/

Step 1: Command Entry Point (review.md)
         ↓ dispatches in PARALLEL to
Step 2: 5 Sub-Agents
         ├─ security-reviewer.md → Checks OWASP Top 10
         ├─ quality-reviewer.md → Checks code smells
         ├─ performance-analyzer.md → Finds bottlenecks
         ├─ ux-reviewer.md → Evaluates UX
         └─ accessibility-reviewer.md → Validates WCAG
         ↓ each auto-loads their skills
Step 3: Skills
         ├─ security-patterns (OWASP knowledge)
         ├─ code-review-patterns (quality heuristics)
         ├─ performance-patterns (optimization techniques)
         ├─ ux-patterns (user experience guidelines)
         └─ accessibility-patterns (WCAG 2.1 AA)
         ↓ produces
Step 4: Consolidated Report (5 dimensions)
```

## Single Plugin = Complete System

### What `plugin.json` Does

```json
{
  "name": "cc10x",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "commands": "./commands/",      ← Includes ALL 5 commands
  "agents": "./agents/",          ← Includes ALL 7 sub-agents
  "skills": "./skills/",          ← Includes ALL 16 skills
  "hooks": "./hooks/"             ← Includes ALL 3 hooks
}
```

**Translation:** When Claude Code reads this `plugin.json`, it:
1. Registers all 5 commands (you can type `/feature-plan`, `/feature-build`, etc.)
2. Loads all 7 sub-agents (available for commands to invoke)
3. Indexes all 16 skills (auto-activate on trigger phrases)
4. Sets up all hooks (run automatically on events)

---

## Installation = Full Package

### What Happens When You Install

```bash
# You run:
/plugin marketplace add romiluz13/cc10x
/plugin install cc10x@romiluz13-cc10x

# Claude Code downloads and installs:
✓ plugin.json (plugin definition)
✓ commands/ (5 command files)
✓ agents/ (7 sub-agent files)
✓ skills/ (16 skill directories with SKILL.md)
✓ hooks/ (hooks.json + 2 shell scripts)

# Immediately available:
✓ All 5 commands work
✓ Commands can invoke any sub-agent
✓ Sub-agents auto-load relevant skills
✓ Hooks trigger on session events
```

**You DON'T install commands/agents/skills separately!**
**They ALL come together in ONE plugin!**

---

## Progressive Loading (Token Efficiency)

Even though you get ALL components, cc10x loads them intelligently:

### Stage 1: Startup (Minimal Load)
- **What:** Command names + descriptions only
- **Tokens:** ~50 tokens per component (250 tokens total for commands)
- **When:** Plugin initialization

### Stage 2: On Invocation (Relevant Context)
- **What:** Full command + relevant sub-agents + relevant skills
- **Tokens:** ~500-1000 tokens per component
- **When:** You type `/feature-plan` or similar

### Stage 3: On Demand (Deep Dive)
- **What:** Complete skill knowledge, detailed examples
- **Tokens:** ~3000+ tokens per skill
- **When:** Skill explicitly requested or complex scenario

**Result:** 93% token savings compared to loading everything upfront!

## Verification: What's Included

Run this in your installed cc10x project:

```bash
# Check commands are available
/feature-plan     # Should work
/feature-build    # Should work
/bug-fix         # Should work
/review          # Should work
/validate        # Should work

# Commands will automatically invoke sub-agents
# Sub-agents will automatically load skills
# You don't manage them separately!
```

## Architecture Guarantees

### ✅ Single Plugin Installation
- One command installs everything
- No separate sub-agent installation
- No separate skill installation
- All components interconnected

### ✅ Orchestration Built-In
- Commands know which sub-agents to invoke
- Sub-agents know which skills to load
- Progressive loading happens automatically
- Token efficiency is automatic

### ✅ Complete Out-of-Box
- All 5 workflows ready
- All 7 specialists ready
- All 16 skills ready
- All 3 hooks ready

- ✅ 16 domain skills that auto-activate
- ✅ 3 automation hooks for context management
- ✅ Full orchestration system (commands → agents → skills)
- ✅ 93% token efficiency through progressive loading
- ✅ Complete documentation and examples

**You DON'T need to:**
- ❌ Install commands separately
