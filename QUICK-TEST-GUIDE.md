# Quick Test Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All fixes have been applied. Here's how to test that everything works.

---

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Created `/inspiration/` with 10 comprehensive research documents
2. ✅ Updated `plugin.json` with component paths
3. ✅ Removed `marketplace.json` (backed up as `marketplace.json.backup`)
4. ✅ Verified directory structure is correct

---

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: restructure as single plugin, add research documentation"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Install in Claude Code

Open Claude Code and run:

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add romiluz13/cc10x

# Install plugin
/plugin install cc10x@cc10x
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check plugin appears
/plugin
# Should list: cc10x@cc10x ✅
```

### Step 4: Test Commands

```bash
# Test feature planning
/feature-plan "Add user authentication system"

# Test feature building  
/feature-build "Implement login form"

# Test bug fixing
/bug-fix "Users can submit empty email"

# Test code review
/review src/
```

All commands should work! ✅

### Step 5: Check Agents

```bash
# List available agents
/agents
```

Should show:
- context-analyzer ✅
- implementer ✅
- security-reviewer ✅
- quality-reviewer ✅
- performance-analyzer ✅
- ux-reviewer ✅
- accessibility-reviewer ✅

### Step 6: Test Skills (Auto-Activation)

Just talk naturally:

```
"I need to implement a feature using test-driven development"
```

The TDD skill should activate automatically! ✅

```
"Help me with systematic debugging"
```

The debugging skill should activate! ✅

### Step 7: Verify Hooks

Hooks run automatically:
- `session-start.sh` - Already ran when you started
- `pre-compact.sh` - Runs before context compaction

---

## Expected Results

✅ Plugin shows in `/plugin` list
✅ Commands execute successfully
✅ Agents appear in `/agents` list
✅ Skills auto-activate on trigger phrases
✅ Hooks run automatically
✅ Everything works!

## If Something Doesn't Work

### Plugin Not Showing?

1. Make sure you pushed changes to GitHub
2. Repository should be public
3. Try: `/plugin marketplace remove cc10x` then re-add
4. Restart Claude Code

### Commands Not Working?

1. Check plugin installed: `/plugin`
2. Verify you're in a trusted directory
3. Try typing `/` and see if commands appear in autocomplete

### Agents Not Listed?

1. They should appear with `/agents`
2. If not, check `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`
3. Agents also auto-invoke based on context

### Skills Not Activating?

1. Skills auto-load at session start
2. Try explicit trigger phrases from skill descriptions
3. Example: "implement with TDD" should trigger TDD skill

---

## Success Indicators

When everything works, you'll see:

1. **Plugin Listed:**
   ```
   /plugin
   → cc10x@cc10x [installed]
   ```

2. **Commands Autocomplete:**
   ```
   /feat[tab]
   → /feature-plan
   → /feature-build
   ```

3. **Agents Available:**
   ```
   /agents
   → 7 agents listed
   ```

4. **Skills Active:**
   ```
   Natural conversation triggers skills automatically
   ```

5. **Workflows Execute:**
   ```
   Commands run full orchestration workflows
   ```
