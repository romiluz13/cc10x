## Lessons for cc10x

Based on marketplace analysis:

1. **Single Plugin Approach is Valid:**
   - EveryInc started with one high-quality plugin
   - Focus trumps quantity
   - Clear value proposition

2. **Structure Matters:**
   - Don't mix marketplace and plugin at root
   - Either be a plugin OR a marketplace
   - Consistency is key

3. **Documentation Wins:**
   - All successful marketplaces have excellent docs
   - Examples are crucial
   - Clear installation instructions

4. **Community Grows Over Time:**
   - Start with your own excellent plugin

   - Expand to marketplace later if needed

**Recommendation:** cc10x should follow EveryInc pattern - start as single excellent plugin, potentially expand to marketplace later.
