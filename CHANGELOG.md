# Changelog

## [3.2.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Perfect Subagent Activation Logic**: Explicit "when to invoke" and "when NOT to invoke" conditions for all workflows
- **Conflict Prevention**: Sequential execution rules and dependency management to prevent overlapping subagent work
- **User Override Support**: Explicit skip conditions that respect user preferences
- **Subagent Format Compliance**: All subagents follow `03-SUBAGENTS.md` format exactly

### Fixed
- **Subagent File Naming**: Renamed 5 subagents from `SKILL.md` to `SUBAGENT.md` (correct format)
- **Plugin.json References**: Updated all 9 subagent references to use `SUBAGENT.md`
- **Workflow References**: Updated all workflow files to reference `SUBAGENT.md` consistently
- **Emoji Cleanup**: Removed all emojis from workflow files, replaced with text markers (`**INVOKE**` / `**SKIP**`)

### Enhanced
- **Review Workflow**: Added scope-based skip logic, selection logic for focused reviews
- **Build Workflow**: Added skip conditions for trivial changes, dependency-only updates
- **Debug Workflow**: Added skip conditions for non-reproducible bugs, trivial fixes
- **Plan Workflow**: Added complexity-based skip logic, dependency management (architecture â†’ design)
- **Orchestrator**: Added subagent invocation rules (verify existence, check skip conditions, respect overrides)

### Changes
- Workflow files now use text markers instead of emojis for professional compatibility
- All subagents verified to follow exact format from documentation
- Enhanced activation logic prevents conflicts and wasted context
