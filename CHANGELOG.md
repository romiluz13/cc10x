All notable changes to cc10x will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added

- **Risk Assessment in Feature Planning**: Phase 3b now includes systematic risk identification, scoring (Probability × Impact), and mitigation strategies integrated into implementation roadmap (inspired by BMAD METHOD)
- **Development Constitution**: Formal `.claude/memory/CONSTITUTION.md` documenting 7 immutable principles (TDD, file sizes, quality gates, production-ready, multi-dimensional review, token efficiency, UI standards) with enforcement and rationale (inspired by GitHub Spec Kit)
- **Workflow Visualization Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams in all command documentation showing decision points, quality gates, and workflow flow (inspired by BMAD METHOD)
- **Cross-Artifact Validation Command**: New `/validate` command for checking plan-code consistency, test coverage gaps, documentation accuracy, and constitution compliance (inspired by Spec Kit's analyze command)
- **Video Production Script**: Complete professional video script with 7-act structure, voiceover timing, and production guide (`docs/archive/guides/VIDEO-SCRIPT.md`)

### Enhanced

- **Commands**: All 5 commands now include Mermaid workflow diagrams for visual understanding
- **Feature Planning**: Includes comprehensive risk scoring matrix with mitigation strategies
- **Documentation**: README now includes Development Constitution summary with links to full document
- **Skills**: feature-planning skill enhanced with Phase 3b risk assessment methodology

### Changed

- **Repository Structure**: Archived all planning, implementation, and research documentation to `docs/archive/` for cleaner production structure
  - Planning docs → `docs/archive/planning/`
  - Implementation docs → `docs/archive/implementation/`
  - Development guides → `docs/archive/guides/`
  - Research and comparative analysis → `docs/archive/research/`
- **Version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 in plugin.json

### Fixed

- **Structure Validation**: Validated all files against official Anthropic plugin specifications
- **plugin.json**: Confirmed exact schema compliance per official documentation
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Validated all commands, agents, and skills have correct YAML syntax
- **Shell Scripts**: Verified all hooks are executable and syntax-valid
- **Root Directory**: Cleaned to production-ready state (only 3 files: LICENSE, README.md, CLAUDE.md)

### Validated

- ✅ plugin.json follows official Anthropic schema (100% compliant)
- ✅ All 5 commands have valid YAML frontmatter and Markdown structure
- ✅ All 7 agents follow official sub-agent format
- ✅ All 16 skills follow official skill format with SKILL.md
- ✅ Hooks configuration valid JSON with executable scripts
- ✅ Production structure matches successful plugins (compounding-engineering pattern)
