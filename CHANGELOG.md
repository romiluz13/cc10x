## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-26

### 🎯 THE FOCUS RULE - Critical Fix for User Control

**Problem Identified:** Orchestrator was losing focus and spending hours on things user didn't ask for.

**Example:**
- User: "Build simple todo app"
- Old behavior: 4 hours on security analysis, deployment planning, risk analysis
- Result: User frustrated, nothing delivered

**THE FIX - THE FOCUS RULE:**

Added at top of orchestrator (lines 42-74):

```markdown
🎯 THE FOCUS RULE (CRITICAL!)

DO WHAT USER ASKED. NOTHING MORE.

- Asked for "build" → ONLY build (NO forced planning!)
- Asked for "review" → ONLY review (NO forced comprehensive analysis!)
- Asked for "fix" → ONLY fix (NO architecture deep dive!)

Default: DIRECT EXECUTION (delivers fast)
Systematic: ONLY if user explicitly requests
```

**Impact:**
- User regains control
- Results delivered quickly
- No endless orchestration loops
- Still systematic when needed, but user chooses

---

### Fixed

**Issue: Never-ending orchestration loops**
- Orchestrator would activate workflows user didn't ask for
- Lost focus on actual request
- Hours wasted on tangential analysis

**Solution:**
- THE FOCUS RULE enforces doing only what user requested
- Quick mode by default
- Full systematic only if explicitly asked
- User controls depth, not orchestrator

---

### Reverted

**v3.0.0 Changes Reverted:**
- Progressive workflows (broke execution - had meta-instructions, no actual logic)
- 4+5 agent restructuring (unnecessary complexity)
- Meta-orchestration (caused infinite loops)

**Why reverted:**
- v3 orchestrator said "Load workflow" with no instructions HOW
- Claude got stuck in loops trying to figure out how to load
- User lost control completely
- Meta-talk about orchestration instead of actual execution

**Lesson learned:** Embedded execution logic works. Meta-instructions don't.

---

### Kept from v3.0 (The Good Parts)

✅ PostToolUse hook (enforces <500 lines automatically)
✅ task-breakdown skill (helpful for TODO generation)
✅ progress-tracker skill (helpful for status reports)
✅ Professional documentation language

---

### Version

- v2.1.0: v2 structure + THE FOCUS RULE + PostToolUse hook + helpful skills
- Not v3.0: That was broken, reverted
- Based on: v2.0 (worked) + focus fix + SpecWeaver inspiration

---

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-25 [REVERTED]

**This version was reverted due to critical execution failures.**

**Problems:**
- Orchestrator had meta-instructions without actual execution logic
- Caused never-ending loops
- Lost user control
- Bloated content 2.4x (3,155 vs 1,325 lines)

**See v2.1.0 for working version with improvements.**

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### 🎉 THE PERFECT FUSION (Complete Architectural Transformation)

**Revolutionary Change:** Fused cc10x_V2-main's simplicity with cc10x v2's proven patterns. Result: World-class systematic development that's both powerful AND efficient.

**Inspired by:** Parallel cc10x_V2-main project analysis + brutal real-world testing feedback

**Breaking Changes:**
- 11 agents → 9 agents (4+5 architecture: 4 core execution + 5 review)
- Monolithic orchestrator (1,325 lines) → TRUE progressive disclosure (150-line core + workflows)
- No quick defaults → Phase 0a quick default plans (avoid 120k waste)
- Separate workflows → End-to-end automation (plan and build in one flow)
- 18 skills → 20 skills (added task-breakdown, progress-tracker)
- Progressive loading: 50-75% token savings (vs v2 monolithic)

---

### 🏗️ 4+5 ARCHITECTURE (Inspired by cc10x_V2-main)

**The Paradigm Shift:**

**Before (v2.0):** 11 agents with overlapping responsibilities, confusing roles
**After (v3.0):** 4 core execution + 5 review = 9 focused agents with clear purposes

**4 Core Execution Agents (Sequential - NEW/ENHANCED):**
1. **feature-planner** (NEW) - Product manager, PRD creation
   - Replaces: requirements-analyst
   - From: cc10x_V2-main pattern
   - Adds: Risk-aware planning, assumption validation
   
2. **architect** (ENHANCED) - System designer
   - Enhanced with: Technology decision framework, file size enforcement
   - From: cc10x_V2-main patterns merged with v2 capabilities
   
3. **code-writer** (NEW) - TDD enforcer
   - Merges: implementer + tdd-enforcer logic
   - From: cc10x_V2-main with TDD integration
   - Enforces: <500 lines, no placeholders, production-ready only
   
4. **test-generator** (NEW) - Testing specialist
   - From: cc10x_V2-main
   - Targets: >80% coverage
   - Requires: Mandatory user verification

**5 Review Agents (Parallel - KEPT, Already Perfect):**
5. security-reviewer
6. quality-reviewer
7. performance-analyzer
8. ux-reviewer
9. accessibility-reviewer

**Status:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 stars verified in brutal testing)

**DELETED (Consolidated):**
- requirements-analyst → Merged into feature-planner
- implementer → Merged into code-writer
- tdd-enforcer → Merged into code-writer
- devops-planner → Logic moved to deployment-patterns skill
- context-analyzer → Logic moved to codebase-navigation skill

---

### 📦 TRUE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE (From cc10x_V2-main)

**The Problem (v2.0):**
- Orchestrator: 1,325 lines in SKILL.md
- ALL loaded when skill triggers
- ~13,000 tokens always loaded
- FALSE "progressive loading" claim

**The Solution (v3.0):**

**New Structure:**
```
cc10x-orchestrator/
├── SKILL.md (150 lines - lightweight core)
├── workflows/
│   ├── review.md (400 lines - loaded for review)
│   ├── plan.md (600 lines - loaded for planning)
│   ├── build.md (500 lines - loaded for building)
│   ├── debug.md (300 lines - loaded for debugging)
│   └── validate.md (200 lines - loaded for validation)
└── templates/
    ├── quick-plan.md (200 lines - Phase 0a)
    └── complexity-assessment.md (100 lines - scoring)
```

**Progressive Loading Levels:**
- Level 1: YAML metadata (always, ~100 tokens)
- Level 2: Core SKILL.md (when triggered, ~1,500 tokens)
- Level 3: Specific workflow (on-demand, ~3,000-6,000 tokens)

**Token Savings:**
- v2: 13,000 tokens always
- v3: 4,500-7,500 tokens (only what's needed)
- **Savings: 50-75%!**

**Inspired by:** cc10x_V2-main's orchestrator-10x structure (SKILL.md + WORKFLOWS.md + PLANNING.md)

---

### 🎯 QUICK DEFAULT PLANS - Phase 0a (NEW!)

**The Problem (v2.0):**
```
v2 Planning workflow:
→ Generated 12 clarifying questions
→ Never asked them
→ Proceeded with assumptions
→ 120k tokens later, user says: "I wanted OAuth! Why didn't you ask?"
→ 120k tokens wasted on wrong assumptions
```

**The Solution (v3.0 Phase 0a):**
```
v3 Planning workflow:
→ Phase 0: Complexity check (1-5 scoring)
→ Phase 0a: Quick default plan (3-5k tokens)
  - Shows intelligent defaults (OAuth: NO, tokens: 15min/7day, etc.)
  - Lists 5-7 critical assumptions
  - Presents 3 options:
    (a) Proceed with defaults (fast track, +30k tokens)
    (b) Customize (ask questions, +40k tokens)
    (c) Manual (quick guidance, +2k tokens, STOP)
→ User validates BEFORE wasting 120k tokens!

Result:
- If assumptions right: 35k total (vs 120k)
- If assumptions wrong: User chooses (b) or (c), avoids waste
- Token savings: 65-95% by stopping early or fast-tracking
```

**Files:**
- `workflows/plan.md` Phase 0a section
- `templates/quick-plan.md` template

---

### 🔄 END-TO-END AUTOMATION (From cc10x_V2-main)

**The Problem (v2.0):**
```
User had to invoke workflows separately:
1. /feature-plan → Planning (30k tokens)
2. Wait for completion
3. /feature-build → Building (60k tokens)
4. Total: 90k tokens, 2 separate invocations
```

**The Solution (v3.0):**
```
User invokes ONCE:
→ /cc10x plan and build authentication

What happens:
1. PLANNING workflow executes (Phase 0a → Full planning)
2. Plan saved to .claude/plans/FEATURE_AUTH.md
3. AUTO-CONTINUES to BUILDING (no second command!)
4. BUILD workflow loads plan, implements with TDD
5. Complete implementation delivered

Result: One command, end-to-end, seamless!
```

**Supported Combinations:**
- "plan and build" → PLAN + BUILD
- "review and refactor" → REVIEW + BUILD
- "debug and fix" → DEBUG + implementation
- "plan, build, and review" → PLAN + BUILD + REVIEW (complete workflow!)

**Implemented in:** Core orchestrator SKILL.md (multi-workflow detection)

---

### 🛡️ MANDATORY TEST VERIFICATION (Reliability Improvement)

**The Problem (v2.0):**
```
code-writer agent reported:
> "✅ All 33 tests passing! 90%+ coverage!"

Reality when user ran tests:
> Tests: 3 failed, 4 passed, 7 total

False success report led to broken code merged!
```

**The Solution (v3.0):**
```
test-generator now REQUIRES user verification:

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERIFICATION REQUIRED

Run independently:
```bash
npm test
echo $?  # Must be 0
```

Verify you see:
- Tests: X passed, X total (no failures)
- Exit code: 0

DO NOT proceed until personally confirmed.

Reply with: "Verified: All tests passing"
```

**Status:** Embedded in test-generator.md and workflows/build.md

---

### 📏 POSTTOOLUSE HOOK ENFORCEMENT (From cc10x_V2-main)

**The Feature:**

After EVERY Write/Edit operation:
1. Hook fires automatically
2. `scripts/validate-file-size.sh` runs
3. Checks file line count
4. If >500 lines: Warning displayed with split suggestions
5. User sees violation immediately

**Implementation:**
- `hooks/hooks.json`: PostToolUse hook configuration
- `scripts/validate-file-size.sh`: Validation script (from cc10x_V2-main)

**Result:** File size rule enforced automatically, not just recommended

---

### 📚 NEW SKILLS (From cc10x_V2-main)

**Added 2 orchestration skills:**

1. **task-breakdown** (240 lines)
   - Converts plans to Claude Code compatible TODO.md
   - Enforces file size constraints per task
   - Marks dependencies clearly
   - Invoked by: BUILD workflow Phase 2

2. **progress-tracker** (322 lines)
   - Generates status reports from TODO.md
   - Tracks velocity, identifies blockers
   - Calculates completion estimates
   - Invoked by: User request

**Total skills:** 20 (was 18)

---

### ♻️ ONE WORKFLOW SCALES (From cc10x_V2-main)

**The Problem (v2.0):**
- Separate simple/complex workflows
- Different paths based on complexity
- More code to maintain
- Complexity in handling simplicity!

**The Solution (v3.0):**
```
ONE workflow, agents scale output naturally:

Simple feature (complexity 2):
→ feature-planner: 200-line PRD, 3-5 stories
→ architect: 150-line design, basic diagram
→ code-writer: 2-3 files, 50-150 LOC
→ test-generator: 10-20 tests

Complex feature (complexity 5):
→ feature-planner: 1,000+ line PRD, 20+ stories
→ architect: 1,000+ line design, comprehensive
→ code-writer: 10-20 files, 1,000+ LOC
→ test-generator: 80-200 tests

Same process, different depth!
```

**Benefit:** Simpler code, natural scaling, no separate paths

---

### 🧹 CLEANED YAML ACROSS ALL SKILLS

**Followed official Anthropic spec strictly:**

```yaml
# v3.0 Standard (All 20 skills)
---
name: skill-name
description: [Comprehensive description embedding WHEN to use]
license: MIT
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob  # Optional but useful
---
```

**Updated:**
- All 20 skills now spec-compliant
- Orchestrator description optimized (400 words)
- All domain skills enhanced (100-200 word descriptions)

---

### Monolithic Orchestrator
- SKILL.md.backup: Old 1,325-line monolithic file (replaced with progressive structure)

## Fixed

### Issues Fixed in v3.0

**Issue 1:** False success reports
- **Fix:** Mandatory user test verification in test-generator and workflows/build.md

**Issue 2:** 120k token waste on wrong assumptions
- **Fix:** Phase 0a quick default plans present assumptions for validation

**Issue 3:** Complexity inflation (simple features scored as complex)
- **Fix:** Honest complexity assessment with recommend-skip for 1-2

---

### 🎯 Key Improvements

**Token Efficiency:**
- v2 monolithic: 13,000 tokens always loaded
- v3 progressive: 1,500 (core) + 3,000-6,000 (workflow) = 4,500-7,500 tokens
- **Real 50-75% savings!**

- v3: Phase 0a presents defaults, gets user validation BEFORE planning
- **Prevents 65-95% waste!**

**End-to-End:**
- v2: Separate invocations (/feature-plan, then /feature-build)
- v3: One command handles both ("plan and build")
- **Seamless automation!**

**Reliability:**
- v2: Agent reported "tests passing" when 3/7 FAILED
- v3: Mandatory user verification (must see with own eyes)
- **Prevents false success!**

**Simplicity:**
- v2: 11 agents (overlapping roles)
- v3: 9 agents (4+5 clear architecture)
- **22% reduction, 100% clarity!**

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### 🎉 SKILLS-FIRST Architecture (Complete Transformation)

**Revolutionary Change:** Skills orchestrate everything. Commands replaced by ONE master orchestrator skill.

**Breaking Changes:**
- 5 separate commands deleted, replaced by ONE master orchestrator skill
- Natural language invocation preferred (or /cc10x wrapper command)
- Skills orchestrate workflows by invoking agents (skills are the conductors)
- All skills follow official Anthropic spec (cleaned YAML frontmatter)
- Token economics completely changed (3-20x MORE than manual, honest positioning)
- Requires manual test verification (prevents false success reports)

---

### 🏗️ SKILLS-FIRST Architecture

**The Paradigm Shift:**

**Before (v1.x):** Commands → Agents → Skills (commands embedded everything)
**After (v2.0):** Skills → Agents → Skills (skills orchestrate workflows!)

**Layer 1: Master Orchestrator SKILL**
- ONE skill (`cc10x-orchestrator`) replaces ALL 5 commands
- Contains all workflow logic (~800 lines)
- Detects task type, assesses complexity, chooses workflow
- Invokes agents and loads domain skills progressively
- Optional thin wrapper command (/cc10x) ensures loading

**Layer 2: Sub-Agents (Execution Workers)**
- 4 NEW agents added (total now 11)
- Enhanced with progressive skill loading instructions
- Invoked by master orchestrator skill
- Load ONLY needed domain skill stages (token-efficient)

**Layer 3: Domain Skills (Knowledge Bases)**
- 2 NEW skills added (total now 18 including master)
- 2 enhanced with progressive stages
- All cleaned to follow official Anthropic spec (YAML compliant)
- Rich content (500-2000 lines each)
- Loaded progressively by agents

---

### 🎯 NEW Master Orchestrator Skill

**`cc10x-orchestrator/SKILL.md`** - The ONE skill to rule them all

**Purpose:** Replaces all 5 separate commands with ONE intelligent orchestrator

**What it does:**
- Detects task type from user messages (review, plan, build, debug, validate)
- Assesses complexity (1-5 scoring) FIRST
- Recommends skip for simple features (saves users from wasting tokens)
- Chooses appropriate workflow based on detection
- Orchestrates specialized sub-agents
- Loads domain skills progressively
- Delivers production-ready results

**Size:** ~800 lines containing all 5 workflow implementations

**Invocation:**
- Natural language: "review this code", "plan auth feature"
- Explicit: "Use cc10x-orchestrator skill to..."
- Slash command: `/cc10x [task]` (thin wrapper for guaranteed loading)

**YAML frontmatter:** Follows official Anthropic spec (only name + description + license)

**Description optimized for triggering:** 400-word comprehensive description embedding all workflow keywords (review, plan, build, debug, validate, systematic, risk analysis, complexity, TDD, LOG FIRST, etc.)

**The paradigm:** Skills ARE the orchestrators, not commands!

---

### 🧹 Cleaned ALL Skill YAML Frontmatter

**Followed official Anthropic spec** (agent_skills_spec.md):

**Removed non-standard fields from ALL 18 skills:**
- ❌ `trigger phrases` (not in official spec - we invented this)
- ❌ `activates on` (not in official spec - we invented this)
- ❌ `progressive: true` (behavior, not metadata)

**Kept only official fields:**
- ✅ `name` (lowercase-hyphen-case)
- ✅ `description` (enhanced for better triggering)
- ✅ `license` (MIT)

**Enhanced descriptions:** All skill descriptions rewritten to be comprehensive, embedding WHEN to use them (following official pattern from anthropics/skills examples)

**Example transformation:**
```yaml
Before:
  trigger phrases: "review", "audit", ...
  activates on: code review, ...
  progressive: true

After:
  description: Comprehensive description that embeds when to use, what it does, how it's loaded, etc.
```

**Files updated:** All 18 skills now spec-compliant

---

### 🗑️ Deleted 5 Command Files

**Commands deleted (redundant with master orchestrator):**
- feature-plan.md (700 lines) → Logic moved to master orchestrator PLANNING workflow
- feature-build.md (900 lines) → Logic moved to master orchestrator BUILDING workflow
- bug-fix.md (500 lines) → Logic moved to master orchestrator DEBUGGING workflow
- review.md (960 lines) → Logic moved to master orchestrator REVIEW workflow
- validate.md (400 lines) → Logic moved to master orchestrator VALIDATION workflow

**Total removed:** ~3,500 lines of command files

**Replaced by:** ONE master orchestrator skill (~800 lines) + ONE thin wrapper command (~100 lines)

**Net reduction:** 2,600 lines (74% reduction!)

---

### ➕ NEW Thin Wrapper Command

**`commands/cc10x.md`** - 100 lines

**Purpose:** Ensures master orchestrator skill loads (fallback since skills don't auto-trigger reliably)

**What it does:**
- Loads cc10x-orchestrator skill
- Passes user request through
- That's it! (thin wrapper)

**Usage:** `/cc10x [your request]`

**Why keep one command?**
- Brutal testing showed 0% auto-trigger rate for skills
- Slash command guarantees skill loads
- Discoverable (/cc10x autocomplete)
- Best of both worlds (skills-first + guaranteed loading)

---

### 📚 Official Anthropic Patterns Followed

**Research sources:**
- ✅ anthropics/skills repository (official examples)
- ✅ agent_skills_spec.md (official specification)
- ✅ skill-creator skill (official orchestrator example)
- ✅ anthropics/claude-code (official plugins)
- ✅ feature-dev plugin (official command + agents structure)

**Key learnings applied:**
1. Skills can be complex orchestrators (validated by skill-creator example)
2. YAML must follow minimal spec (only name + description required)
3. Description field determines triggering (embed WHEN to use)
4. Skills don't need special trigger syntax (good description is enough)
5. Plugins can have skills directory (non-standard but valid)

**Result:** cc10x v2.0 follows official patterns while innovating with master orchestrator approach

### 🎯 Cursor IDE Enhancements Integrated

**From Cursor IDE planning mode:**

**Complexity Assessment (Phase 3c):**
- 1-5 scoring: TRIVIAL → SIMPLE → MODERATE → COMPLEX → VERY COMPLEX
- Honest cc10x value analysis
- Recommends skip if complexity < 3
- Token economics comparison (cc10x vs manual)
- Real test data integrated (rate limiting failure)

**File Change Manifest (Phase 5b):**
- CREATE/MODIFY/DELETE breakdown with LOC estimates
- Integration points mapped
- Verification checklist
- Prevents scope creep (flags unplanned files)
- 90%+ match required

**Rollback Strategy (Phase 6):**
- < 5 minute recovery target (Level 1)
- 3-level escalation (flag → config → code)
- Clear rollback triggers (when to execute)
- Specific procedures with commands
- Estimated recovery time per level

**Deployment Plan (Phase 7):**
- 5-stage rollout (Infrastructure → Integration → Canary → Partial → Full)
- Risk categorization (ZERO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Wait times between stages
- Monitoring dashboards and metrics
- Success criteria and alert thresholds

---

### ✅ Real Progressive Loading (Finally!)

**v1.x (FALSE claim):**
- Commands embedded everything: 15,000 tokens upfront
- No actual progressive loading
- "93% savings" was a lie

**v2.0 (REAL implementation):**
- Commands are thin: 200 tokens
- Agents load skills on-demand: 3,000-5,000 tokens total
- **Actual savings: 65-79% (vs v1.x embedded approach)**

**Example (feature-plan):**
```
v1.x: 15,000 tokens upfront
v2.0 simple: 3,200 tokens (79% savings!) - stops at complexity assessment
v2.0 complex: 5,200 tokens (65% savings!) - full workflow

Real progressive loading achieved through:
1. Thin command orchestrators (200 tokens)
2. Agents invoked on-demand (not all at once)
3. Skills loaded stage-by-stage (only what's needed)
```

---

### 🛡️ Mandatory Verification (Prevents False Success)

**The Problem (v1.x):**
- implementer agent reported: "✅ All 33 tests passing!"
- Reality: 3 out of 7 tests FAILED
- Root cause: Reports not verified

**The Solution (v2.0):**
- Added Stage 3 to test-driven-development skill (Mandatory Verification)
- Added verification section to implementer agent
- Added verification requirement to feature-build command Phase 4
- tdd-enforcer agent enforces verification

**Requirements:**
- Run actual test command (`npm test`)
- Capture real output (don't summarize)
- Verify exit code = 0 (with `echo $?`)
- Visual confirmation (see ✓ symbols)
- Never trust reports without verification

---

### 📊 Token Economics Reality

**Honest Comparison:**

| Feature Type | cc10x v2.0 | Manual | Verdict |
|--------------|------------|--------|---------|
| TRIVIAL (1) | 40k tokens | 2k tokens | ❌ 20x MORE - Skip cc10x |
| SIMPLE (2) | 80k tokens | 5k tokens | ❌ 16x MORE - Skip cc10x |
| MODERATE (3) | 100k tokens | 15k tokens | ⚠️ 7x MORE - Maybe skip |
| COMPLEX (4) | 120k tokens | 30k tokens | ✅ 4x MORE - Worth it |
| VERY COMPLEX (5) | 180k tokens | 50k tokens | ✅ 4x MORE - Worth it |

**Exception:** /review always worth it (prevents security breaches)

**Why MORE expensive:**
- Systematic multi-phase analysis
- Risk analysis at multiple phases
- Documentation generation
- Quality gate overhead
- Progressive loading still has setup cost

**Why worth it for 4-5:**
- Prevents architecture mistakes (one rewrite = 80k+ tokens wasted)
- Catches security issues (one breach = infinite cost)
- Prevents scope creep (file manifest tracking)
- Enables fast rollback (< 5 min recovery)

---

### 🧠 "What Could Go Wrong?" Methodology

**Integrated 7-dimension risk analysis everywhere:**

**7 Dimensions:**
1. Data Flow & Transformations (input validation, edge cases)
2. Dependency & Integration (circular deps, version conflicts)
3. Timing, Concurrency & State (race conditions, TOCTOU)
4. User Experience & Human Factors (accessibility, error messages)
5. Security & Validation (SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass)
6. Performance & Scalability (O(n²), memory leaks)
7. Failure Modes & Recovery (error handling, graceful degradation)

**Invocation points:**
- Planning (architect): Stages 1+5 (Data Flow + Security before architecture)
- Implementation (implementer): Stages 1+3+7 before each increment
- Review (quality-reviewer): ALL 7 stages (comprehensive)
- Security (security-reviewer): Stages 1+2+5 (security-focused)
- Deployment (devops-planner): Stage 7 (Failure Modes inform rollback)

**Result:** Finds edge cases before production does

---

### 🎯 Honest Positioning

**"When NOT to Use" added to ALL commands:**
- /feature-plan: Skip for complexity 1-2, well-documented libraries
- /feature-build: Skip for complexity <3, time-sensitive, need reliability
- /bug-fix: Skip for obvious fixes, emergencies
- /review: Skip for trivial changes, non-code, WIP (but use liberally otherwise!)
- /validate: Skip if no plan exists, still in dev

**Token Economics sections added to ALL commands:**
- Honest comparison (cc10x vs manual)
- Reality check (3-20x MORE, not savings)
- "Is it worth it?" tables
- Specific complexity recommendations

**Emphasized /review as killer feature:**
- Changed priority from 8 to 10
- Added ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ rating in title
- Added "cc10x's Killer Feature" subtitle
- "Worth every token" economics section
- Real test results (38 issues, 5 CRITICAL)

### 🔄 Progressive Loading Implementation

**How it actually works now:**

**Command structure (200 tokens):**
```markdown
Phase 1: Invoke requirements-analyst
Phase 2: Invoke context-analyzer
Phase 3: Invoke architect
...
```

**Agent loading (progressive):**
```markdown
requirements-analyst:
  → Loads feature-planning Stage 1 only (500 tokens)
  
context-analyzer:
  → Loads codebase-navigation Stages 1-2 (1,100 tokens)
  
architect:
  → Loads feature-planning Stage 2 (800 tokens)
  → Loads risk-analysis Stages 1+5 (1,400 tokens)
  → Loads feature-planning Stage 3 (400 tokens)
  → Loads feature-planning Stage 4 (600 tokens)
  ... (continues based on complexity)
```

**Token savings calculation:**
- v1.x embedded: 15,000 tokens upfront
- v2.0 simple (stops early): 3,200 tokens (79% savings)
- v2.0 complex (full workflow): 5,200 tokens (65% savings)

**This is REAL progressive loading**, not the false v1.x claim.

### 🚀 Progressive Loading Token Savings Breakdown

**Example: /feature-plan for WebSockets (Complexity 4)**

| Phase | Agent | Skill Loaded | Tokens |
|-------|-------|--------------|--------|
| Command | - | Orchestration logic | 200 |
| Phase 1 | requirements-analyst | feature-planning Stage 1 | 500 |
| Phase 2 | context-analyzer | codebase-navigation Stages 1-2 | 1,100 |
| Phase 3 | architect | feature-planning Stage 2 | 800 |
| Phase 3a | architect | risk-analysis Stages 1+5 | 1,400 |
| Phase 3b | architect | feature-planning Stage 3 | 400 |
| Phase 3c | architect | feature-planning Stage 4 | 600 |
| Phase 4 | architect | test-driven-development Stage 1 | 600 |
| Phase 5 | architect | (general patterns) | 200 |
| Phase 5b | architect | feature-planning Stage 5 | 500 |
| Phase 6 | devops-planner | risk-analysis Stage 7 | 700 |
| Phase 6 | devops-planner | deployment-patterns Stage 1 | 400 |
| Phase 7 | devops-planner | deployment-patterns Stage 2 | 600 |
| **Total** | | | **8,000 tokens** |

**Compare to:**
- v1.x embedded: 15,000 tokens (47% savings!)
- Pure manual: 20,000 tokens (60% savings!)

**Wait, why MORE than manual?**
- Manual loads: 20k of trial-and-error, ad-hoc exploration
- cc10x: 8k systematic analysis (less token churn, more structured)
- For simple features manual is still better (5k vs 40k cc10x total)

---

### 💯 Quality Improvements

**Before (v1.x):**
- Claimed benefits that didn't exist
- Hidden token costs
- No guidance on when to skip
- No verification of results
- False sense of security

**After (v2.0):**
- Brutally honest about costs
- Clear when to skip
- Mandatory verification
- Real progressive loading
- Reality-based expectations

---

## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0

**Breaking Changes:**

1. **Commands are thinner**
   - Expect different structure
   - Same invocation: `/feature-plan`, `/feature-build`, etc.
   - Output format similar but more comprehensive

2. **Agents list expanded**
   - Old: 7 agents
   - New: 11 agents (4 new)
   - May need to update if you referenced agent names

3. **Skills list expanded**
   - Old: 16 skills
   - New: 17 skills (2 new: risk-analysis, deployment-patterns)

4. **Token usage increased**
   - v1.x: 15k base + execution
   - v2.0: 5.2k base + execution
   - BUT v2.0 more comprehensive (risk analysis, complexity, manifest, rollback, deployment)

5. **Verification required**
   - Must manually verify test outputs
   - Can't trust "all tests passing" claims
   - Must run actual test command

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All command invocations still work
- Output locations same (`.claude/plans/`)
- Workflow phases similar

**New Capabilities:**
- Complexity assessment (recommends skip if appropriate)
- File manifests (track scope)
- Rollback procedures (< 5 min recovery)
- Deployment plans (staged rollout)
- Risk analysis (what could go wrong)
