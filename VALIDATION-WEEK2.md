## ✅ Progressive Loading Validation

All 6 new skills follow the 3-stage progressive loading pattern:

| Skill | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Progressive Flag |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| security-patterns | 50 tokens | 500 tokens | 3,000 tokens | ✅ `progressive: true` |
| performance-patterns | 50 tokens | 500 tokens | 3,000 tokens | ✅ `progressive: true` |
| ux-patterns | 50 tokens | 500 tokens | 2,500 tokens | ✅ `progressive: true` |
| accessibility-patterns | 50 tokens | 500 tokens | 2,500 tokens | ✅ `progressive: true` |
| code-review-patterns | 50 tokens | 500 tokens | 2,500 tokens | ✅ `progressive: true` |
| safe-refactoring | 50 tokens | 500 tokens | 2,000 tokens | ✅ `progressive: true` |

**Total at startup**: 300 tokens (6 skills × 50) vs 16,500 full load = **98.2% reduction**
