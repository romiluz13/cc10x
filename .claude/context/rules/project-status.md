# Project Status - cc10x Orchestration System

**Project**: cc10x
**Version**: 0.1.0 (Development)
**Status**: Week 1 - Foundation Phase
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22

---

## Project Overview

**cc10x** is an intelligent orchestration system for Claude Code that combines sub-agents, skills, and smart context management to achieve 10x developer productivity.

**Core Innovation**: Perfect orchestration of specialized workers (sub-agents) with domain knowledge (skills) and token-efficient context loading.

---

## Current State

### What Works ✅

**Core Infrastructure**:
- ✅ Plugin manifest and directory structure
- ✅ CLAUDE.md (orchestrator brain with auto-healing)
- ✅ settings.json (SessionStart hook, parallel rules)
- ✅ working-plan.md (auto-loaded on start)
- ✅ context.json (progressive loading configuration)

**Sub-Agents** (2 operational):
- ✅ implementer - TDD-driven code implementation
- ✅ context-analyzer - Codebase pattern discovery

**Skills** (4 operational):
- ✅ test-driven-development - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR enforcement
- ✅ code-generation - Clean code patterns
- ✅ codebase-navigation - Efficient exploration
- ✅ verification-before-completion - Production readiness

**Workflows** (1 operational):
- ✅ /feature-build - 5-phase feature development

### What's Next ⏳

**Immediate** (Current Sprint):
- 🔄 Progressive loading retrofit for existing skills
- 🔄 Additional alwaysApply context files
- ⏳ /bug-fix workflow
- ⏳ End-to-end testing

**Soon** (Week 2):
- Additional 8 skills (debugging, architecture, security, etc.)
- Additional 6 sub-agents (reviewers, optimizers)
- /review workflow
- Skills with executable scripts

---

## Technology Stack

**Language**: Markdown (skills, sub-agents, commands), TypeScript (scripts)
**Platform**: Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Plugin System**: Claude Code Plugin API
**Architecture**: Orchestrator + Sub-Agents + Skills pattern

---

## Key Principles

1. **Never parallelize implementers** - File conflicts guaranteed
2. **Always run quality gates** - Catch issues before production
3. **Progressive context loading** - Token efficiency (5k vs 80k startup)
4. **Auto-healing at 75%** - Never hit context limit
5. **Test-first always** - TDD strictly enforced

## Development Workflow

When building cc10x itself:

1. **Plan** - Document in working-plan.md
2. **Implement** - Use TDD (we eat our own dog food!)
3. **Test** - Verify with real projects
4. **Document** - Update this file and working-plan.md
5. **Iterate** - Refine based on usage

---

## Success Metrics

**Week 1 Goals** (Current):
- Core structure: ✅ 100%
- Essential skills: 🔄 33% (4/12)
- Essential sub-agents: 🔄 25% (2/8)
- First workflow: ✅ 100%

**Overall Vision**:
- 70% faster feature development
- 90% success rate (first try)
- <80% token usage per workflow
- 95% fewer bugs in production

---

## Known Limitations

**Current** (will be addressed):
- Only 1 workflow (/feature-build) - Need bug-fix and review
- Skills not yet progressive (full load every time)
- No end-to-end testing yet
- No skills with executable scripts yet

**By Design**:
- No parallel implementers (prevents conflicts)
- Quality gates block progress (enforces standards)
- Auto-healing may interrupt flow (necessary for long sessions)

---

## Quick Reference

**Key Files**:
- CLAUDE.md - Read this for orchestration rules
- settings.json - Configuration and hooks
- working-plan.md - Current status and next tasks

**Active Workflows**:
- /feature-build - Feature development (5 phases, 25-35 min)

**Contact/Issues**:
- Repository: (to be published)
- Issues: Track in working-plan.md for now
