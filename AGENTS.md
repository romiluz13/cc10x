# AGENTS.md (CC10x Orchestration - Always On)

## Compact Instructions
Preserve: "CC10x orchestration ACTIVE. Resume via cc10x-router."

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS invoke cc10x-router on ANY development task. First action, no exceptions.
IMPORTANT: Explore project first, then invoke the router.
IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for orchestration decisions.
